Notwithstanding the different names, his species are the same
as here accepted, recognized already by GRISEBAOH. I scarcely
venture to suppose, that his remark under V. havanensis: »The
specimens at hand fall into two groups, the first With leaves long—
-attenuate at base, almost sessile, and thin in texture3 the
second with leaves cuneate into a distinct petiole, and firm
in texture», should be due to some confusion with V. menthae-
solim· but this species cao? greatly resemble V. havanensis.

GLEASON applies (1913, p. 330) to this species V. Ottom's
Scir-Bw„ as well as V. lm‘erarcioides GRISEB. However, the type
specimen of the formeris typical V. menthaejolia (POEPP.) LESS.‚
and the latter is the same as V. Orientis GLEASON. WRIGHT’S
number 1306 includes both V. cubcnsis GRISEB. and V. hiera- .
cioides GRISEB. Probably the specimens so numbered in the
GRAY Herbarium, which was consulted by GLEASON, are all
V. cubenszsss GRISEB.

The three species of Vernonz'ae havanenses are by no means
very good oneS. V, cztbensis GRISEB. in many respects is inter—
mediate between V. humanensis DC. and V. hieracioides GRISEB.
Some of the specimens cited above are suspected not to bc
quite correctly determined.
