Besides this, there are well-marked differenees in the
structure of the flowers and the pappus. However‚ Ι have
had a rather scanty material to examine, and the differences
found thus cannot be published here.

The names V. Friedrichsthaliz· and V. striqosa are not
to be considered as published in this paper.

From V. Trinitatis, or some closely related specieS‚ V.
arborescens (L.) Sw. may have originated. Especially the spe-
cimen collected by LooKHART greatly resembles this species.
