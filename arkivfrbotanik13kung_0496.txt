and a Nilssonia?, both from Rodalsberg.

NATHORST ¹ mentions in the same year some of the fossil
plants from Kurremolla‚ viz, an Anomozamites, a small Equi-
setum, fragments of Ctenis, and a small Saqenopteris.

In ToRNEBoHM and HENNIG’S 2 description of the geolo-
gical map of the solid rocks of Scania several important
notes on the ocal-bearing formation in the south-eastern part
of the province are communicated. Two sections are given
which may be reproduced here in order to illustrate the ge0‹
logical structure at the localities yielding the fossil floras.

Fig. l. Sections of the Mesozoic series at Rodalsberg (A) and »Tosterups
vestra grans» (Β). (From ToRNEBoHM δε HENNIG, after MOBERG.)

Our text—fig. 1 represents two sections of the Mesozoic
strata at Rodalsberg (ToRNEBOHM δι Hamus, 1. c.‚ text-fig.
40, p. 114, after observations of MOBERG.). In the extreme
north—east of section A, the Upper Silurian (Gotlandian)
Posidonomya shale is seen, dipping steeply towards south-
west and abruptly cut off by a fault‘l-ine. Immediately S.W.
of this fault-line follow almost perpendicular strata of sand-
stone and clay belonging to the Keuper. Then follow clay
and sandstone beds with a gradually decreasing NE. dip,

belonging to the plant-bearing series. The plant-remains ,

{ound jn wthe clay close to the Keuper constitute the Flora
