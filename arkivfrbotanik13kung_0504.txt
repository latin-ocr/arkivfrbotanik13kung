eral others of the same kind occur in the collection, but
none of the specimens show any nodes or any traces of leaf-
sheaths. Their equisetaceous nature is probable only because
of the existence of very distinct longitudinal ribs on the im-
pressions (or interior casts), which evidently correspond to
decorticated interior surfaces. Fragments of this nature have
often been described under the names Schizoneura and Phyllo-
theca. The genus Equisetz'tes, however, in a decorticated
state, has exactly the same kind of ridges: and it is evident
that, in specimens of this kind, the three genera mentioned,

as well as Neocalamites, cannot be distinguished from each
other.

Stem-fragments of Equisetitesss (Of. E. Mimzsteri STBG.)
Pl. 1, figs. 20, 21.

The stem-fragments shown in pl. 1, figs. 20 and 21, are
probably of equisetaceous nature, and may well belong to
the genus Equisetz‘tes. As compared with those shown in
figs. 18 and 19 of the same plate, they are distinguished by
much broader furrows between the ribs. In regard to this
character there is an undeniable resemblance to Equisetiles
Mum-teri STBG„ but as no leaf-sheaths or nodes are preserved,
a definite determination is impossible.

In the rust-coloured sandstone of Rodalsberg there occur
a couple of small fragments of a Cladophlebis which may be
compared with C. nebbensis (BRGN.) NATH. — this species
being taken in a wide sense, as including also O. Roesserti
(PRESL) SAP.

The best specimen is the one figured in pl. 2, figs. 1 and
2. It consists of two pinnules, evidently attached to a pinna-
rachis. The pinnules are about 12 mm. long, fairly narrow,
falcate and acute. Their secondary veins are directed for-
