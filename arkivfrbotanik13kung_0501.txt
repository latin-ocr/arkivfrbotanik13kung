agree with this interpretation and differs on the whole some-
what from SCHENK’S descriptions. The material is too poor,
however, to permit of any certain conelusions.

In the little fragment in pl. l, fig. 4, there appear to
be some faint traces of the venation, agreeing fairly well
with SCHENK's illustrations. ‚

Gutbiera anqzcstz'loba is typically a Rhaetic species, and is
known from several districts In Scania it has been found

in the Rhaetic beds of Palsjc and possibly Billesholm andin
the Liassic of Sofiero and Hor.

Most of the plant-remains in the plant-bearing clay at
Munka Tagarp belong to Wocdwardites microlobus sermm,
which was recorded from this locality by Prof. Momm,
after identification by Prof. NATHORST‚ in 1893.

All the- speoimens are very small, representing portions
of single pinnae, but the characteristic venation ensures a
safe determination even of such minute fragments. The largest
specimens att-ain only a length of 1 em. with a breadth of
5 mm. The pinna—rachis is very slender‚ the pinnules linear
— ovate, confluent at the base, with entire or crenulate margins
and obtuse apices. The midribs and the secondary veins of
the pinnules are distinct; the. finer veins cannot he observed.
The reticulate nature of the venation, characteristic of the
genus, is evident‚ the secondary veins forming bow-shaped
anastomoses with each other, as is best seen in figs. S and
16, pl. l. In some of the enlarged figures in pl. 1, another
characteristic feature of the venation is shown. The first pair
of secondary veins in each pinnule run in a straight course
parallel with the rachis, those of adjacent pinnules meeting
and joining each other. These veins thus form. together
with the pinna-rachis and the lowermost parts of the mid-
ribs of the pinnules, very long, narrowly rectangular fields
