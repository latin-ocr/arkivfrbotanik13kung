E. L. EKMAN, WEST INDIAN VERNONIAE. 5

Most probably Vernoma lepidota GRISEBA(·H is to be made
the representative of a new genus.

Verreonia Miller-2· JoflNSTON 110111 the island of Margarita
was described in the year 1905. 11 13 evidently an Olissantlze·5‚
having few-flowered heads, narrow involucres. and broad,
somewhat curled scales 01 1110 inner series 01 pappus.

As for the delixnitation of the sections of the genus, I have
adopted the treatment given by HOFFMAN in ENGLER and
PRANTL: Die Natiirlichen Pflanzenfamilien‚ with the except-
ions already mentioned. Save Piptocarpha tetrsmztlea UR-
BAN, and some introduced species, all west Indian Verno-
niae belong to 1110 section Lepidaploa (CAss.) DC.

Within this Section Lepiclaploa the species have been
before exclusively artificially grouped. The first attempt
to arrange the species according 10 111011 relationships was
made by GLEASON in his »Revision of the North American
Vernonieae». He 00110011)ν recognized several groups 01
3Ρο0103, for instance, the Fruticosae and the Atyyropapysae,
but most of his other groups include species 01 different ori—
gin. He also has proceeded too far in splitting up the divi-
sions 01 Lepidaploa, placing, for instance, V. (ιίἷγίεαῑιῖῑῖδἱ PERS.
(z V. lonqisolz'a PERS.) in a particular group Lonqifoliae,
separated from its nearest relative, V. icosantha DC. (z V.
arborescere& SW. of this paper). Especially unfortunate is
he in arranging the forms 01 V. divaricata SW., some 01 which
he takes to be distinct species, putting them into three
different species-groups (V. arborescens GLEASON, not Sw.
among his Arbor-escente& V. albicoma among the D‹2†2·ar1·catae,
V. per-mollis and V. intonsa constituting a particular spe-
cies-group). He is, further, absolutely wrong in assigning V.
lepidota GRISEB. 10 1110 Scorpioideae reductoe, V. pallescens
GLEASON to the Ramnenses, V. canescens H. B. K. to the Dep-
peanoe, many other mistakes not to be mentioned.

I have tried, in this paper, to arrange the species accord-
ing to their relationships in subsections based in the first
place on the characteristics of the inflorescense, in the second
place on the pubescence 01 achenes and corollas and on the
structure 01 1110 pappus. The arrangement proposed 13 by
no means definitive. All delimitation of taxonomic units
in Vernonia is extremely difficult, from that of the species
up to the genus.
