the specimen in the SURIAN Herbarium .(P) as the type of
C'onyza amborescens L. rather than the plant in LINNAEus's her-
barium, as this only partly corresponds with his description.
LINNAEUS himself seems to have laid more stress upon the plant
sigured by PLUMIER, to judge by his specific name of the
plant, Ο. arborescens, the name taken from »Eupatorium arbo-
rescens floribus caeruleis», PLUM. l. c. It is puzzling that
he has not quoted the 'synonym in BROWNE, Jam., p. 313,
under his O. arborescens, which he would certainly have
done, if he had considered the Jamaican specimen in writing
the description. It seems as though Ο. arborescens had been
originally based upon the figure of PLUMIER, and had had its
description 'afterwards somewhat modified according to the
Jamaican plant.

If the name C. arborescens goes with the description,
it must be the Jamaican plant which should be named V. ar-
borescere& (L.) SW. The Martinique plant of PLUMIER should
then be called V. icoscmtha DC.

Later on in the year 1759 LINNAEUS attributed, in Pu-
gillus Jamaicensium plantarum, Amoen. Acad. Vol. 5, p.
406, to his C. arborescens the synonym of BROWNE already
mentioned, and another synonym also referring to the Jam-
aican species from SLOANE. In this way the incorrect
application of Ο. arborescens to the Jamaican plant became
more decisive.

OLOF SWARTZ, in fact, on his return from Jamaica, saw
in London the plant of BROWNE and SLOANE, and taking
this to be the genuine Conyza arboresce‘ns, he described it in
his Observationes, p. 304. On the same plant he afterwards,
in Flora Indiae occidentalis, based his Vernom'a arbore-scen&
Thus the Vernom'a arborescens became definitely a Jamaican
plant. Consequently, when it became evident that the Mar<
tinique plant was different from the Jamaioan one, the former
was described as a new species, viZ. V. icosantha DC. A general
vagueness, however, as to the correct application of the name
V. arbore-scens gradually crept in, so that nearly all species
of the Arborescentes have borne the name.

Thus do matters stand up to the end of the nineteenth
century. At length, the demand for a consistent nomen-
clatum had begun to make itself felt. The routes of the
ancient travellers were studied in order to ascertain where
