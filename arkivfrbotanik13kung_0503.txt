HJ. MoLLER AND T. G. HALLE, FOSSIL FLORA OF S.E. SCANIA. ll

Schenki, appear to be sufficient for a fairly accurate determina-
tion of the age of the plant-bed. They have all their chief
distribution in Rhaetic rocks, occurring‚ inter alia, in the type
district of Franconia. In Sweden all three species are known
from the upper part of the Rhaetic series of north-western
Scania, Gutbiera anqustiloba oecurring possibly already in the
zone with Lepidopterc's Ottom’s at Billesholm. The same spe-
cies, and also leaumatopteris Sclzenlcz· — the occurrence of which
at Munka Tagarp is not certain, however -—- extend up to the
Liassic of Hor. There can be no doubt that the plant-bed
is of Rhaetic age; and it would appear probable‚ from what
is known of the geological distribution of the species, that
the horizon belongs to the upper part of that· formation.
The fact- that the plant—bed occurs only l‚5 m. above the
Keuper would seem to speak for a lower Rhaetic age3 but,
as has been remarked by ToRNEBOHM δε HENNJG (l. c.‚ p.
115), it is possible that the short distance between the plant-
bed and the Keuper may be due to a fault.

2. 'I'he Flora of Rodalsberg.

The stratigraphical position of the plant-bearing bed at
Rodalsberg may be seen from the Section given in text-fig. 1
(p. 4). It is considerably higher up in the series than the
plant-bed at Munka Tagarp, but it lies probably a long dis-
tance below the Cardimn-bed. The plant-bearing rock is a
rust-coloured, fairly fine-grained sandstone, which occurs in
close connection with a thin seam of poor coal. The plant-
remains occur as impressions‚ without any trace of the vege-
table tissue. On account of the fract-ured state of the rock,
they are very fragmentary and, moreover‚ not very distinct
as a rule. The material, which has been collected by MOBERG‚
will be described below.

Equisetaceous stem-fragments.

In pl. 1, figs. 18 and 19‚ are shown two fragments which
are probably the remains of some equisetaceous stems. Sev-
