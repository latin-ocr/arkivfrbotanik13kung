The species has, as far as I know, only been collected
by SwARTz.

The problem of the affinities of this species has caused
bot-anists much trouble. SWARTZ himself, in describing it,
supposed it to be closely allied to V. fruticosa (L.) SW.‚
which, however, was not correct. GRISEBACH‚ in his Flora,
referred to it not only V. fruticosa, but also the species of the
subsection Sayroeanoe, together with V. emarqzssnata W⁷1KSTR.!
GLEASON at first followed GRISEBACH‚ identifying in his »Re-
vision» V. riqida and V. fruticosa, and placing them among the
Saffloeanoe. Recently he has found that V. rigida. is another
species than V. fruticosa, and that it is not to be placed to
his Sayraeanoe. However‚ he does not mention anything about
the affinities of the species, authentic specimens of which he
has not seen.

Having abundant material at hand of the species in ques-
tion, it was an easy matter for me to ascertain that V. riqida
SW. is quite different both from V. fruticosa, V. emar-qimam,
and Vernom'oe Saqroeanoe. Its relationships, however, still
remained questionablefflntil in an examination of the unnamed
Compositae of the Stockhohn Herbarium I lighted upon a Ver-
nonia from the West Indies collected by SWARTZ, and presented
by him to the Swedish botanist Momm, which Vernonia
had some characters 01 V. riqicla and some of V. acmninata
LESS. Through this fortunate incident I was enabled to state
that the nearest ally of V. riqida is V. acuminata LESS. A
