The resemblance lies especially in the habit, at least the
smaller specimens of ZIGNo's (l. c., pl. 3, figs. 2, 4, 5; pl. 4,
figs. 1—3) being very similar to the Swedish ones. ZIGNo’s
description and the enlarged drawing in his pl. 3, fig. 4,
however, show a considerable difference: the Italian form
has the free teeth shorter and more abruptly and bluntly
pointed. Ε. Εῃεῖἶὶ, a well-known species of the Wealden‚ has
teeth of very much the same shape as Ε. Moberqii, but it is
generally considerably larger, with longer and more numerous
teeth. The resemblance is a very close one, however, and
it would appear as if E. Lyellz' was the species most closely
related to Ε. Ilffoberqiz'.

There are in the collection a couple of disc-like bodies
which no doubt represent diaphragms of this species. One
of them is shown in our pl. 2, fig. 23. It is rather large,
about 10 mm. in diameter, with a thin marginal zone. In
the centre there is a more distinct circular impression, with
a diameter of about-5 mm„ marked off by means of a circle
of small dots.

The small fragment in pl. 3, fig. 8, may be described in
this connection. It is probably also a diaphragm but is dif-
ferent from the one now described. It is much smaller, only
about 2 mm., and has some radiating lines reaching from
the margin almost to the centre. This specimen may have
belonged to a branch, but its exact position or structure
cannot be determined. Similar objects have been described in
other species as diasphragms, so for instance in Ε. lateralis
PHILL (E. columnaris BRGN.) by several authors and further
in Ε. broraensis STOPEsl and Ε. gyracz'lz's NATH. (HALLE,1. (3.,
pl. 3, fig. 15). In the latter specimen the relation to the
leaf-sheath is so close that its nature of a diaphragm can
hardly be doubted.

It is important to note that, whereas Ε. Moberqii may
be kept as a separate species, it is more closely related to

younger forms, particularly Ε. Ᾰῃεῖἷί, than to the Rhaetic
Ε. illim-steri.
