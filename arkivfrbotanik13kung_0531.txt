the present strobilus belongs to that species. This connec—
tion, however, cannot be proved.

Masculostrobus sp. 2.
Pl. 6, figs. 11—13.

As M asculostrobus sp. 2 may be designated a kind of small
male strobili, of which the best specimen is shown in pl. 6,
figs. 11—13.

All the specimens of this form are small and fragmentary,
the largest reaching a length of rather less than 20 mm. The
descript-ion will be based on the somewhat smaller but better
preserved specimen in fig. 11. The sporophylls form a rather
wide but not a right angle to the axis. They have a length
of about 2 mm. and are somewhat bont upwards. In their
lower parts they are very slender and stalk-like3 at the apex
they widen rapidly, thus assuming a cuneate shape. It is
not possible to decide whether they were peltate, with the
stalk attached to the centre of a transverse apical lamina,
but it would rather appear as if the stalk gradually passed
over into the lower end of the latter. The diameter of
this lamina is O‚5—O‚s mm. The sporophylls occasionally
bear what appears to be traces of pollen-sacs. One such in-
stance is shown in fig. 12, in which a pollen—sac is seen
closely applied to the stall< of the sporophyll3 another is re-
presented in fig. 13. No further details of the structure can
be made out, and the fragments are of too poor a quality to
permit of a comparison with any other either recent or fossil
forms.

Masculostrobus sp. 3.
Pl. 6, figs. 14—18.

The commonest as well as the best preserved of the
male strobili at Kurremolla is the one here described as
Masculostrobus sp. 3, and figured in pl. 6, figs. 14—18.

The largest specimens, which, however, only represent
portions of strobili‚ measure rather less than 25 mm. in length.
The shape was probably cylindrical. The sporophylls are
perpendicular to the axis or nearly so: they are about 4—5
