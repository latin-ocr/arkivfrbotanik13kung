The subsection Arborescentes as here conceived includes
species of very different habits. It matches GLEASON’S Scor-
pioiclece joliatae, his smaller groups Fruticosae and Schiecleanae
excluded. Some of his Scorpioicleae aqqreyatoe also belong
here, like all his Scorpioiclece reductoe. It may be, however,
that the subsection‚ as here defined, is not quite monophyl-
etic. One of the species referred to it, namely V. Trinitatis
EKMAN, differs somewhat in habit from the genuine Arbo-
rescentes‚ and is strongly allied to some Mexican and South
American species. Ι have tried to distinguish it by floral
characters from the Arborescentes, but in vain. Probably
it 15, like 501110 of its allies, an annual plant, differing as to
that respect from the Arborescentes‚· but Ι have no evidence
for this supposition.

In fact, as easy as it is to distinguish the Arborescentes from
other West Indian subsections, as difficult is it 10 determine
where the line between the subsection and some South Ame-
rican species is to be drawn. As far south as the Argen-
tine province of Corrientes, species occur strongly recalling
the Arborescentes in habit. Ι am firmly convinced that numbers
of species from South America are 10 be referred in future ’
130 11115 subsection.

With this I have stated that the Arborescentes have their
nearest allies in South America, and probably 1110 subsection
