HJ. MoLLER AND T. G. HALLE, Fossn. FLORA or ΞΕ. soANIA. 17

A similar feature has been described in the case of N. poly-
morplca by NATHORST ¹, who has later expressed the opinion
that the dots are caused by resinous grains which are eom-
monly found in preparations of the leaves of that species.

Baiera? sp.
Pl. 2, fig. 16.

The fragment in pl. 2, fig. 16, may possibly represent
the lower portion of a leaf of Baiera. It is wedge-like with
spreading dichotomizing veins and is broken at both ends.
It would appear as if it was bnanched, which would streng-
then the probability of its being a Baiera, but this is not
certain.

Pityophyllum? sp.
Pl. 2, figs. 17, 18.

The small fragments shown in pl. 2, figs. 17 and 18,
appear to represent coniferous leaves of the Pityophyllum-
type. The largest specimen has a length of only 15 mm.;
the breadth is 1——2 mm. In both specimens there is a dis-
tinct midrib.

In the following table all the plant-remains described
above from Rodalsberg are enumerated. The distribution of
such forms as are to any extent determinable is indicated
for some important plant-bearing formatioris.

It is seen from the table that of the five forms which
are identified or compared with known species three occur
in both Rhaetic and Liassic strata, viz, Gladophlebis cs. neb-
heusis, Gufflz'era anqustiloba and Saqenopteris cf. Nilssom'ana.
Of the others Dictyophyllum splibnsteri is typically a Rhaetic
species. Cladophlebis Zobisolia has its chief distribution in
the Middle Jurassi03 it has been recorded, however, not only
from the supposed Liassic flora of Bagaa in Bornholm but
also as probably occurring in the Rhaetic of Tonkin.
