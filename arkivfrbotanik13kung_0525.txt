HJ. MoLLER AND T. G. HALLE. FOSSIL FLORA OF S.E. SCANIA. 31

, The close resemblance of this form to the Wealden spe-
cies N. schaumbmvensis (DUNK.) NATH. has already been
pointed out by Prof. NATHORST (l. c.‚ 1909, p. 27). N.
schaumburqensis was first described by DUNKERl as a species
of Pterophyllum and was later referred by ΞΟΗΙΜΡΕΡ»2 to
Anomozamz'tes. In that· genus the species remained‚ until it
was assigned by Nmnonsrss to its proper place, in Nilssonia.
After a close comparison of the Kurremolla form with typical
Wealden specimens of N. schaumburqensis, the best of which
are those figured by SCHENK,4 it has not been possible to
discover any difference, except that the former has more
rounded segments and possibly a little more slender rachis.
It is indeed possible that the two forms are identical, which
would appear more probable now that a number of VVealden
elements have been recognized in the Kurremolla flora than
at the time when the species was instituted. It appears best,
however, to retain for the present the name N. fallace given
to the Kurremolla form, while emphasizing its close agree-
ment with N. schaumburqensis. The latter is exclusively a
VVealden or Lower Cretaceous species of wide distribution,
being known not only from different districts in Europe but
also from Japan and North America.

In addition to Nil-ssonia fallax NATH. there occurs at
Kurremolla a fragment of another species of that- genus. The
specimen consists only of a single segment, almost square in
shape, with very dense veins (ΞΟ-30 in a centimetre) which
are normally simple but show a couple of bifurcations. There
is a certain resemblance to N. clensinervis (Fon.) BERRY, as
