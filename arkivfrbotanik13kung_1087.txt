their plants han been collected. Thus it became obvious,
in our caso, that the type of V. (arbore-scens could not be the
Jamaican plant, PLUMOER and SURIAN never having visited
Jamaica. In 1902 Prof. lGN. URBAN succeeded in recognizing
the type of V. arborescens in a plant sent by Duss from Mar-
finique, though he did not publish his discovery. I am happy
to mention that on a visit to Paris Ι found the Conyza arbo-
rescens in the SURIAN Herbarium, fasc. 2, 11. 198. It is the
same plant as that of Duss, and represents a 10111)ν form of
V. icosantha DC. The SURIAN plant must bc considered as
the type of V. arborescens (L.)‚ being most probany the origin-
al of the figure in PLUM. cd. BURM.

The application of the name V. arborescens to the Mar-
tinique plant being thus adopted herc, an interesting question
remains. How to quote the author of the combination
V. arborescens (L.)2 The first to transfer Gonyza arborescens
L. into Vernonia was SWARTZ. But the description of his
V. arborescens is incorrect, as is its distribution, SwARTz
having the Jamaican plant in mind. Now the question is:
can SWARTZ be cited as author of the combination V. arbo-
rescens (L.), applied to the fllartim'que plant? I think hc can,
and must, be so cited. For the operation of transferring a spe-
cies from one genus into another is a matter independent of the
plant at the same time described. The new combination
formed belongs to the same plant to which the original name
was given3 it has, in other words, the same type as this, the
two names are typonyms in the American sense of the word.
And the one who first published it is to be cited as author
of the combination. Thus in our case, SWARTZ is to be cited
for V. arborescens (L.)‚ and this name has for its type the
type of Oonyza arborescens L. WVhen SWARTZ refers the Jam-
aican plant to his combination, it is simply a false determin-
ation. I have asked Prof. URBAN for his opinion on this
matter, and he answered me: »Die Vernonia arboreseens-
-Frage ist mir vollst'andig gegenwartig‚ da ich bereits vor
Vielen Jahren die Plumiersche Abbildung mit Vernonia ico-
santha DC. von Martinique identifiziert habe. . . . Friiher
war ich auch der Meinung‚ dass man auf Grund einer solchen
Identifizierung nochmals die Combination vornehinen und
seinen eigenen Namen als Autor dahinter schreiben soll.
Ich habe sie jetzt aufgegeben, weil sie unpraktisch und nicht
