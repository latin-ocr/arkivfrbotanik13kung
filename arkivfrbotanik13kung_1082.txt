The description of this new species has been made from
the specimens of the KRUG-URBAN Herbarium. The plant
collected by LOCKHART is very badly preserved, nearly all
heads being discharged, without braqteal leaves. Its leaves
are somewhat larger than those of the type specimen, 15
cm long by 7 cm wide3 otherwise it agrees well with it.

V. Trinitatis belongs to a little group of species very
nearly related to each other. The best known of these spe-
cies is V. arqyropappa BUEK (z- V. Poeppz’qiana DC. Prodr.
p. 55, not V⁴ Poeppz'yz'ana DC. Prodr. p. 20. DE CANDOLLE
in his Prodromus described two V. Poeppiqianae. BUEK,
having observed the fault, nullified the name of the second
species, calling it Vargqyropappa. This name should be retained
ior the species, even though the first V. Poeppiqiana is now
referred to Piptocarpha). The other species of the group are
V. Miersmna GARDN. from eastern Brazil (= V. Salzmannii
BAKER in ΕΙ. Bras., not V. Salzmannii DQ), V. virens Son.-
-ΒΙΡ, from Central Brazil, V. hirsutivena GLEASON from Yuca-
tan, and two not published species, V. Friedrichsthalii SCR-
-ΒΙΡ, mscr. from Guatemala—Columbia and V. striqosa SCH.-'
-ΒΙΡ, mser. from Mexico. The species in question are, in fact,
very closely related, and might be united into one single, though
extraordinarily variable, species. However, I prefer not to
do so. They look, after all, rather dissimilar, they are easily
characterized, and they have, moreover, their particular geo-
graphical ranges. The following key gives their characteristic&

I. Outer scales very long-cuspidate.
A. Lcaves rounded at base, velvety-pubescent beneath.
