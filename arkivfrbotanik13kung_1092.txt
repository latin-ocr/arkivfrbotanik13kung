Though early collected (represented, 101· instance, in the
herbaria of VAILLANT, LAMAROK and JUSSIEU) the species
did not get its valid name, V. albicaulz's PERS., till the year
1807. Certainly, there are two older binomia] synonyms
for it, both 01 WILLDENOW, viz. Eupatorium obtusisolium
and Conyza qlabra, but these specific names are invalidated
by Vernonia obtusisolz'a LESS. and Vernom'a qlabra VATKE,
both valid names. Vemania albicaulz's PERs. was published
in the same work, even on the same page as its synonym V.
lonqijolia PERs. The latter name has generally been used
for the species. When I take the first to be valid, my
strongest reason is the fact that V. albicaulis precedes V.
lonqijolia on the page, the former being numbered ll, the se-
cond 12. Further, V. albicaulis represents a central form⁸
01 the specics, V. Zonqisolz'a an outlying one. Since GLEASON
in his »Revision» uses the name V. albicaulis, it will surely,
not appear too unfamiliar.

V. albicaulis is the Vernonia of the Leeward Islands, as
its near relative V. arborescens (L.) SW. is the Vernonia 01
the WVindward Islands. It is true that I have seen several =
specimens collected, according to their labels, in other islands. ¹
Collectors, however, have not always been so cautious with
their statements as in our days. The labels were often writ-
ten a long time after the plants had been collected, and lapses
01 memory were consequently likely to occur. On the distri-
bution 01 the plants, labcls may often have been interchanged.
Howcver, these specimens presumably erroneously labelled are
very few compared with the abundance 01 material collected
in the Lccward Islands. 1. have seen the following: Mayer-
hoff, Hispaniola‚ in 1852 (B). In habit this plant agrees
exactly with specimens of V. albicaulzls· from St. Thomas Ἴ
and it may, indced, have bccn collected there. No other col· 4
lector has V. albicaulis from Hispaniola. —— >›N:o 370. Coniza .’
