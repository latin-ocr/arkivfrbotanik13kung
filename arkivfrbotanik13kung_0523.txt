HJ. MoLLER ΛΝΒ Τ. G'. HALLE, FOSSIL FLORs OF sn. SCANLA. 29

In his first communication on the plant-remains from
Kurremfflla, NATHORST (l. c.) noted the presence of actems,
not very different from G. falcata LINDL. This plant is very
common at Kurremolla‚ its remains sometimes quite covering
the bedding planes. All the specimens are very fragmentary,
however, and do not permit of a specific identification.

The best specimens are shown in pl. 5, figs. 8—10. Like
all the others, they consist only of portions of detached
pinnae. The shape of the latter cannot be ascertained, but
they appear to have been linear with fairly abruptly tapered
apices. The largest fragments (figs. 9 and 10) have a breadth
of about 20 mm., the others are somewhat narrower. The
venation is distinct and shows the anastomoses characteristic
of the genus. There is some variation in regard to the
closeness of the venation, the average distance between the
veins varying from 0‚75 mm. to l,5 mm. In the fragment
shown in fig. 9, the veins are fairly distant, With very few
anastomoces, and remarkably parallel.

The genus is represented in the coal-bearing deposits of
N.W. Scania by Ο. jallax NATHORST.1 From that species
the present fragments differ, however, in having considerably
denser veins. The undescribed specimens from Hor approach
somewhat the Kurremolla form, but even these have a coarser
venation. ΒΑΟΙΒΟΗΞΚΙ2 has described from the supposed
Middle Jurassic of Poland not less than six species, a couple
of which (especially the specimen in his pl. 16) fairly closely
resemble the Kurremolla specimens. No identification with
any of them can be attempted, however. The English type
specieS‚ C. faloam LINDL.3, is also, as already remarked by
NATHORST, somewhat similar to the present specimens‚ but

it has narrower pinnae and cannot be specifically identical
with the Kurremolla form.
