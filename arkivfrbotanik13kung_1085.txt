The history of this species goes back to the remarkable
voyage of PLUMIER and sUmAN in 1689—90. Having dis-
covered it, most probably, in Martinique, PLUMIER figured
it in PLUM. ed. BURM., tab. 130, fig. 2, and upon this figure
LINNAEUS in Systema Naturae, 1759, p. 1213 based his Co-
nyza arborescens.

There is a point to be discussed in this connection.
The passage in Systema Naturae, ed. X, where LlNNAEUs
describes Conwyza arborescens reads as follows: »(f. (arbore-
scens) fol. ovatis integerrimis subtus tomentosis‚ spicis recur-
vatis secundis, bract. reflexis. Plum. ic. t. 130. 1. 2.» The
description is not merely copied from PLUMIER3 for LmNAEUS
has given here some characters of his species that must refer
to another plant than that figured by PLUMIER, for instance
the statements ›>fol. ...subtus tomentosis, spicis recurva-
tis». There is full evidence as to which plant these statements
refer to, In 1758 LINNAEUS had purchased a set of plants collected
in Jamaica by PATRICK Baownn, and among these plants
there was a specimen of a Vernom‘a, the same which Ι 111011-
tion in this paper‚ on p. 59, as V. divaricata SW. This specimen
15 now in the Linnaean Herbarium in London. When I was
there in 1910, Ι 110(1 not yet decided to study especially the
VVest Indian Vernoniae, and I only stated that under Ο. arbo-
rescens in the Linnaean Herbarium there were two plants:
the one V. divaricata SW. from Jamaioa, labelled in LINNfflus’s
handwriting »Gonyza arboresccns» from ›>Br.»; the other
V. scorpioides (ΒΑΜ.) PERs. from Guyana. Prof. C. A. M.
LINDMAN subsequently (in 1912) visited the Linnaean Society‚
and obliged me by making a brief description and an exact
drawing of the two specimens in question. I thus easily
ascertained that the remarks »fol . .. subtus tomentosis.
spicis recurvatis» refer to the plant collected by BROWNE.
Another statement in the description of Conyza arborescens,
»bracteis reflexis», seems to refer to the plant figured by
PLUMIER, the specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium showing
only a few small bracts. As matters now stand, Ι think
we have better take the figure of PLUMIER connected with
