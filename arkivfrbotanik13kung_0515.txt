One of the most characteristic plants at Kurremolla is
an Equisetites which has already been described by MoLLER
(HALLE‚ l. 6.) 35 3 new 5966165, Ε. 111οό619ίί MoLL. A more
complete description of this 5966165, which seems to come
fairly near to some known forms, will be given here.

Stems articulate With smooth 11116111οᾶ65, sometimes
showing a very fine sculpture but no longitudinal ribs or
furrows, On the impressions the stems measure 4—7 mm. in
breadth3 1116 length of the internodes varies between 10 and
25 mm. The leaf-sheaths are closely adpressed 10 the stem:
their teeth can be traced 10 3 length of 3—7 mm. To the
greater part of their length, the teeth are connected with
each other by means of the tissue of the commissural furrows.
The free portioris of the teeth are rather short, 3—4,5 mm.
long 31 the most, gradually tapering, with acute apices. The
number of the segments of each sheath is generally 8—10
on the impression, the whole number thus 16—20.

This form has been kept here under the name Eqm'setiz‘es
Moberyz'i, because it does not· agree exactly with any known
species, but it is evident that it 6011165» very near to a 6011916
of forms previously described. The resemblance 10 Ε. sslic'n—
steri noted in the first description of the species (l. e.)
appears to be rather remote: the absence* of externa] ribs,
the more numerous, narrow and pointed teeth are important
differenees. There is a much closer agreement with two
younger 5966165, viz. E. Bunbmyanus Z1GN.1 an Ε. Lyelli
ΜΑΝΤ.2 Ε. 1110661911 5661115 10 06611957 311 intermediate position
between these two species. Ε. Bzmburyanus, from the Ba-
thonian of Italy, is perhaps the less closely related form.
