As early as the year 1696 this species was introduced
into the annals 01 Botany by SLOANE in his Catalogue, and
shortly after, in the year 1707, 110 described it accurately
in his Natural History 01 Jamaioa. PATR'IOK BROWNE also
gave a good description 01 it in Civil and'Natural History of
Jamaica, p. 313.

I have shown while discussing the name V. arborescens
(L.) Sw. how SWARTZ came to apply this name to the J amaican
plant. In the same passage I have mentioned the reasons
for applying the name V. arboresccns to the Martinique plant.
Then there arises a problem: what is to be the correct name
01 the Jamaican plant, the previous V. arborescens. At first
I thought it must be V. intonsa GLEASON‚ this species agreeing
perfectly with the type specimen of V. arborescens SW. How-
ever, when I realized that V. arboresccns sensu SWARTZII,
V. intonsa GLEASON. V. permollis GLEAs0N‚ V. albicoma
GLEASON and even V. divaricata SW. all were only forms 01
one species, I merely had to take V. divaricata Sw. forits name.
With this the problem 01 the synonymy 01 this Jamaioan
species had been definitively solved.

It is hardly necessary to state that V. divaricata as
here understood is an extremely variable species. GLEASON
having abundant, new-collected material 01 it at his disposal,
described some 01 its forms as new species, viZ. V. permollis,
V. intonsa, V. albicoma and V. amaranthina. Of these V.
intonsa is exactly the same as the type of V. arborescens SW„
V. pcrmollis is an extraordinarily densely pubescent form,
and V. albicoma a nearly glabrous one. I have not perfectly
satisfiod myself about the taxonomic value of V. albicoma,
