If this section is compared with the one given by Momm,
the agreement is found to be almost. complete, and it may
therefore be supposed to be close to the latter. The djp of
the strat-a is mostly 70³ towards NE„ but varies between
60ε and 850.

The clay containing the plant-remains is blackish in
colour and much fractured‚ so that the plants mostly occur
as small fragments. Of some of the species, however, fairly
good specimens have been obtained. The material has been
collected by Prof. NATHORST, Prof. Monimo, Mr. A. F. CARI,-
sos and Dr. Momm, the larger part by Prof. MOBERG.
