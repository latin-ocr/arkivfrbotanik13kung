Carpolithus sp. 2.
Pl. 6, sigs. 19, 20.

As Carpolithus sp. 2 may be described here a kind of
seed which is rather common at Kurremolla. It is figured
in pl. 6, figs. 19 and 20. Fig. 19 represents a number of
seeds grouped together in such a manner that they would
appear to have been attached to some common axis or other
body. The seeds, which are ovate on the impression, vary
rather much in size being from 7 to 15 mm. long. Afeature
peculiar to them all is that the surface‚ which shows no
sculpture, is very wrinkled.

 

In the following table all the plant-remains described
above from Kurremo'lla are enumerated. For comparison
has been noted the occurrence of identical or related species
in some important comparable floras.

The table shows clearly that the flora of Kurremolla has
no close affinity with the other floras of S. E. Scania, viz.
those of Munka Tagarp and Rodalsberg. Not a single spe-
cies can with any degree of accuracy be stated to be iden-
tical with such occurring in these floras, the- identity of t-he
Cladopldebis from Kurremolla with O. lobijolz’a being very
questionable. On the whole, the relation to the Lower Ju-
rassic floras must be admitted to be very slight. In addition
to the form of Cladophlebis mentioned, there is only one spe-
cies — of Splzenopteris —— that appears to come near to a
Liassic form, in this case Diclcsonia pauciloba MoLL. from the
Bagaa Flora of Bornholm. The determination is very un-
certain, however, and this type of frond is one which attains
its maximum development in the Middle Jurassic. To the
Rhaetic there appears to be a still slighter relation, the only
form showing any close resemblance to a species from that
formation being the one described as Laccopterz's sp. 1 which
may be compared with L. eleyans. The material is very
poor, however, and the form may equally well be compared
with L. Woodwardi of the Middle Jurassic.

All the forms which afford any fairly reliable evidence
regarding the age of the flora seem to point to a considerably
