A specimen of a SaqenopteriS, figured in pl. 2, fig. 11,
and possibly some other more imperfect fragments, appear
to belong to S. Nilssoniana (BRGN.) WARD (= S. rhozfsolia
PRESL). It represents a single leaflet, which seems to
have been of ovate shape. The venation consists of a dis·
tinct midrib and secondary veins anastomosing to form a
network with meshes of the shape characteristic of the spe-
cies. The specimen displays no difference whatever from
typical Saqenopterz's Naflssoniana, but it must be admitted

that this species is not well defined against S. Goeppertiana κ

ZIGN. from the Jurassic of Italy and other districts.

Saqenopteris Nilssoniana is fairly common in the coal-
bearing series of north-western Scania. It is known from
Palsjo‚ Sofiero, Hor and Domp'ang, i. e. from beds belonging
to the upper Rhaetic and the Lias. Outside Sweden it is
known from many Rhaetic and Liassic areas, inter alia, from
the Bagaa-flora of Bornholm.

Several specimens of a Nilssonia occur at Rodalsberg‚
but they are too small and fragmentary to permit of a de-
finite identification. The best specimens are shown in pl. 2,
figs. 12—15. The fragment in fig. 12, shown in magnifica-
tion in fig. 13, may represent an entire segment of a species
of the N. polymorpha-typefi, but it is not certain that it be-
longs to that speeies, which usually has much larger dimen-
sions. The fragment in fig. 14 appears to represent a por-
tion of an entire frond, not cut up into segments. In both
specimens the Veins are of the characteristic Nilssonia-type:
they are denser than is usually the case in N. polymorpha,
but in small specimens of that species the veins may be
fairly dense, too.

A peculiar character is indicated in fig. 13, viz. the
occurrence of small dots in the inter-spaces between the veins,
