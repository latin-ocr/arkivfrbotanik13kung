immersis subtus adspersis, ramulis floriferis erectiusculis
subcorymbosis nec divaricatis floribus confertioribus». Spe-
cimens of it have been early distributed as V. divaricata
SW. van, and so DE CANDOLLE and others were caused to
take it as the genuine V. divaricata. LESSING, however,
who applied this name to our V. arborescens, the Martinique
plant, realized that thc variety of SWARTZ was a new species,
and described it as V. acuminata LEss.

The wrong idea, however, of this species being the genuine
V. divaricata Sw. continued to flourish. As rccently as in
1906 GLEASON cites V. acuminata LESS. as a synonym to V.
divaricata SW. In his »Studies» he states the two species
to be different, but applies, in fact, the name V. divaricata
to the genuine V. acuminata, and uses the latter name for a
somewhat many-flowered variety of the same species! I have
not seen the specimen cited to his V. acuminata, VVRIGHT
n. 20, which is said to have 18-flowered heads, those of V.
divaricata sensu GLEASON having only 11—13 flowers (com-
pare with this the statement of LESSING in the original descrip-
tion of V. acuminata: »Capitula 15-flora», which is correct,
the heads being 14—15-flowered). But HARRIS n. 8205 in
the KRUG-URBAN Herbarium, having 16—17-flowered heads,
may agree with GLEASON’s V. acuminata, as it also agrees
With typical V. acuminata in all respects‚ save in the number
of flowers. Hence I conclude that, in spite of all, the V. diva-
ricata and V. acuminata of GLEASON are only one species,
namely V. acuminata LESS. As I have shown in another
passage, V. divaricata Sw. is the species called by GLEASON
V. arborescens.

The species varies but little, and is always easily recognized
by its nearly glabrous leaves, acuminated towards both ends,
by its pale brown heads in leafy cymes, and by its brown
pappus. I had wondered long about the statement made
by GRISEBACH in his Flora: »Pappus straW-coloured», until
in the Grisebach Herbarium I saw a specimen of V. acuminata
having, in fact, just that colour of the pappus. Otherwise
it does not differ som the genuine V. acvrninata; also the struc-
ture of the flowers is throughout the same.
