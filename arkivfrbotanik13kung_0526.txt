Stem of a cycadophyte.
Pl. 5, figs. 11, 12.

In pl. 5, fig. 11, is figured a specimen which in all pro-
bability represents an impression 01 a cycadophytean stem. It
measures only 40 mm. in length, with a breadth of about
8 mm. The surface 01 the impression shows more or less
distinct scats, 01 which the outlines are not always clearly
defined. These scars show a certain variation in shape. These
coveriug the larger part of the stem are rather large, round-
edly rhombic to triangular, 4-5 mm. broad and about 3 mm.
high. In the upper part 01 each soar there are a number,
usually five, 01 small dots which evidently represent scars 01
the leaf-traces. ¹ These are arranged in a crescent, with its
conoave side upwards. It may be pointed out, however,
that it is difficult to decide which is the upper and which
the lower end 01 the specimen, since probably only part of
the leaf-traces are shown and their arrangement shows a great
variation in the Cycadophyta (01. the text-figures given by
WIELAND2). These larger leaf-scars are interrupted by more
or less marked zones 01 others, which are much lower in
respect to their breadt 1. These have a breadth about corre-
sponding to that 01 the others, but a height 01 only 1-—2
111111. The zones 01 low scars are fairly narrow and distant
more than 1 cm. from each other. They are not very dis-
tinct, but it is evident that there really exists an alternat-ion
of two kinds 01 scars. It is believed, in other similar stems,
that the large scars are caused by the leaves, the lower ones
by scales.

The specimen, and a couple 01 similar ones still more
imperfectly preserved, may be compared with the stems of
W ielandiella (Williamsom'a) (mqustisolia, described by NAT-
HORST.3 Also under the name 01 Bucklandia have been de-
