of Munka Tagarp described in this paper. Some distance
further west occurs the rust-coloured sandstone which in-
cludes the Flora of Rodalsberg. The section B, which is not
continuous with A but may be combined with it, represents
the higher (in the section lower) parts of the series with the
Cardium-bed, belonging to the lower part of the Middle Lias.
Still further SW. follows the CretaceouS. The Rhaetic age of
the Munka Tagarp Flora, already stated by NATHORST, and its
position in respect to the Cardiam-bed clearly show that the
sequence of strata is inverted, as first proved by MOBERG.

Text-fig. 2 is a section of the corresponding beds at
Kurrem'olla, from the same work (TORNEBOHM & HENNIG,
l. c., text-fig. 39, p. 113, after observations of MOBERG). The
Silurian at the NE. end of the section is separated, as at
Rodalsberg‚ by a fault from the plant-bearing series, The
fossiliferous horizon nearest the the fault-line is the Cardiam-
bed which dips, as does the whole series, steeply towards
-the Silurian in NE. A considerable distance further SW.
come the coal-bearing beds with the flora of Kurremolla.
As remarked above, the corresponding series at· Rodalsberg
is inverted, and ToRNEBoHM ὅτ, HENNIG point out that it
is but natural to suppose the same to be the case at Kurre-
molla. The flora should then be younger than the Cardiam-bed,
which would agree with its young character noted by NAT-
HORST. In the table illustrating the sequence of strata, the
flora of Kurremolla is accordingly placed, with a sign of
interrogation, at the top of the Rhaetic—Liassic series of Sca-
nia (ToRNEBoHM δε ΗΕΝΝΙα, l. c., p. 121).

Recent contributions to our subject are chiefly of a pa-
laeobotanical nature. MoLLER described in 1908 ¹ a new species
of Equi-saites, Ε. Moberqii MoLL. from Kurremolla. The
species is only compared with E. Mansteri STERNB. In 1909
NATHORST2 stated that the supposed Anomozamites from
Kurremolla is a Nile-sonia. It is recognized as a new species,
N. fallax NATH.‚ with the remark that it may be regarded
as a forerunner to N. schaumburqensis (DUNK.) of the Weal-
den. The following year another species was described by
