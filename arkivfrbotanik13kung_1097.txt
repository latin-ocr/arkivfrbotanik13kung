In collections from the tropics hybrids are only very
seldom found, apparently because the collectors have been
collecting by chance, without knowing the species. In our
case, however, the probability of getting the hybrid was a
greater one, both the parents, V. albicaulis and V. sericea,
being doubtless familiar to collectors like EGGERS and SIN-
TENIS. In fact, not less than four particular collections of
the hybrid have been made.

The hybridous nature of our plant is clearly manifested
by the fact, that in all characters it is intermediate between
its supposed parents It constitutes a particular type, having
characters of both parents, and only of them. Since V. al-
bic-aulis and V. sericea have never been found to pass into
each other, it cannot be considered merely as an intergrad-
ing form. However‚ its pollen seems to be rather good.
The grains are somewhat cornered and dark-coloured‚ and
do not swell swiftly when boiled in milk acid and water. The
achenes are well evoluted.

The best character of the hybrid is the length of its an-
thers. V. albicauhs has large anthers, 2,5 mm in length, V.
sericea very small ones, only O,8 mm long. Now the hybrid
has quite intermediate anthers, 1,ss mm in length. As to
the leaves it is rather variable, EGGERs n. 3256 having leaves
of V. albicaulis sensu strict. and HORNEMANN like those of
V. sericea.. The inflorescence resembles that of V. sericea.
The involucres are larger than those of V. sericea, including
15—16 flowers (in V. sericea 11—-13, in V. albicaulis 20—21);
as to their form they are intermediate. The scales resemble
those of V. albicaulis, yet the outer ones are cuspidate, as
in V. sericea, and the inner ones often somewhat purplish,
as in that species. The colour of the pappus is tawny.
