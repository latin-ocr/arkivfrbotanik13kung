Masculostrobus sp. 1.
Pl. 6, figs. 9, 10.

There occur at Kurremolla a number of specimens which
may with fairly great confidence be regarded as male strobili
of gymnosperms. The preservation of these remains is good,
but they are rather fragmentary, and it appears best, there-
fore, to refrain from both specific identification with known
forms and creation of new specific names. The forms which
can be with some confidence distinguished may be described
under the generic name of Masculostrobus SEWARD.

As Masculostrobus sp. 1 will be described here the spe-
cimen in pl. 6, fig. 9, of which the counterpart is also in the
collection. The specimen figured is an impression of the outer sur-
face of the strobilus. The bracts (sporophylls) appear to have
been peltate in shape, but it would seem as if the stalk were
attached nearer the lower edge of the tangentially enlarged
distal lamina. The latter is somewhat roundedly rhombic to
triangular, about l,5 mm. in diameter, and shows on the
impression a distinctly marked furrow, which runs from the
lower edge of the lamina to above its centre and evidently
corresponds to a ridge on the actual specimen. The stalks
of the bracts are seen on the counterpart to be rather slender‚ ¹

but no details of their structure can be made out, nor are ,

there any traces of the pollen—sacs.

Though no sporangia can be perceived, it is fairly
probable that this specimen is a male strobilus. It is
possible that it represents a peculiar mode of preservation
of one of the forms described below, but this cannot be
decided. There is a certain resemblance to an illustration
given by SEWARD1 of a male strobilus referred to Paqio-
phyllum Williamsoni (BRGN.) Sssw. This has the same shape
of the terminal laminae as the present specimen, and also
similar longitudinal ridges on their surfaces. As there
exists in the Kurremolla flora a form which may be closely
compared with another nearly allied species of Payiophyllum,
or Elatides according to the present nomenclature‚ viz. Ε.
curvijolz'a (DUNK.) NATH„ it appears fairly probable that
