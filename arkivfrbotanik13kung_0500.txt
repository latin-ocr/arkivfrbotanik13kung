The material from this locality has been collected by
MOBERG. Only three species can be identified, which will
be described below. In the description no attempt has been
made to give full lists of synonyms: for such, reference may

be made to the papers by NATHORST‚ MoLLER etc. quoted
in that connexion.

Gutbiera anqustiloba is represented by a fairly large num-
ber of fragments of detached pinnules. They are all very
small, measuring 5—7 mm. in length and hardly 2 mm. in
breadth at the most. The midrib is distinct, and in some
specimens the secondary veinS, which arise at very wide cr
about right angles, can be traeed for some distance.

Figs. 2 and 3, pl. 1, are enlarged drawings of two coun-
terparts, one of which is shown in natural size in fig. 1. The
surface in these specimens is divided up into regular square
fields corresponding each to the area between two adjacent
secondary veins. These areas are convex on the impression
of the lower, concave on that of the upper side.

The two fragments in pl. 1, figs. 5 and 6, are the coun-
terparts of each other, representing the impressions of the
two sides of the upper part of a pinnule. The lamina is
divided up into fields as in the specimens already described,
each area being, in this case also, convex on the impression
of the lower side and conca've on the counterpart. In the
middle of each area there is, on the impression of the lower
side, a minute dot-like elevation, to which appears to corres-
pond a depression in the counterpart. These dots were suppo-
sed by SCHENK1 to represent pores in the indusia covering
the sori. The structure of the present specimens does not well
