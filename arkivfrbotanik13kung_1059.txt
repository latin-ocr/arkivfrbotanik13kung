E. L. EKMAN, WEST INDIAN VERNONIAE. 17

this is the true V. Wriqhtz’i SCH.-B1P.‚as shown by the descrip-
tion and the handwriting of Scnumz-Bffommcs. Gm-
SEBACH, in his Cat. Plant. cub„ p. 144, applies the namo
of V. Wriyhtiz‘ to the plant generally numbcrcd 1309, which
is V. leptoclada SCH.—B1P. Not accepting this plant as a
specicS, he cites it as a form of V. arbores-cens SW., though
maintaining the binomial writing (»V. Wriqlztii Son„ forma
foliis angustioribus subtus tomentosis, capitulis folio florali
multo brevioribus »). He does not mention anything about
V. leptoclacla Soa—BH). GLEASON, who has read the descrip-
tions of SOHULTz-BIPONTINUS, but not discovered the mys-
tery of the interchanged lade, in the »Revisioxm assigns cor-
rectly V. Wriqhtii Scir-Bm to his Fruticosae (i. e. his &192⁴oe-
anae), though as a synonym of V. Saqroeana DC. He applics,
further, the name of V. leptoclada to the plant which in fact corre-
sponds to V. Wriqhtic'. The truc V. leptoclada SCH.-B1P.he refers
to V. qnaphalz'jolia A. Rmrr„ and consequently describes the
genuine V. yhaphalz'jolia, which thus had no name at its dis—
posal, as a new species, V. emblemata GLEASON. His remarks
on V. qnaphalifolz'a A. RICH. read as follows: »Vernom'a W riqhtz'z'
GRISEB. l. c.; Not V. Wriqhtz‘i Sca-Bm», and further:
»Wright’s collection, 1309, included two species, one a form
with broad smooth leaves, V. Sam-ecana DC„ and the other
with tomentose leaves. The first was taken by SCHULTZ
as the type of his V. Wriqlztz'i. GR18E13A(3H‚ apparently consid-
ering that the number included but one species, published
the name for the second form, thus introducing the syno-
nyms cited above». Evidently, this is an attempt of GLEA—
SON to explain the lack of harmony found between the
descriptions of SCHULTz-BIPONTINUS and the plants cor-
respondjng to them according to their numbers. In work-
ing out his ›>Studies» he had learnt that his V. sublanata
is identical with V. qnaphalisolia A. RICH. Thus his V. yna-
phalijolia had no name, and consequently he names it V.
neqlecta GLEASON, creating in this manner one synonym more
for the true V. leptoclada Sca-Bm Stil] believing that this
species belongs to the Sayraeanae, he identifies with it SHAFER
n. 8145, a genuine V. Wriqthii ΒΘΗ-ΒΗ). Another plant,
SHAFER n. 7738, he refers to V. eriqhtii, though with some
reservation. However, it differs from the genuine V. Wriqhtz'i
