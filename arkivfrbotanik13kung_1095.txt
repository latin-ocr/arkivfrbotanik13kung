collected in St. Croix and in Montscrrat (Conyza qlabra WILLD.
resembles this), the other having small, obtuse leaves (dim.
2,7—5 >< l,6-—2,5 cm), which are very often curled or undu-
lated at thc margin. Thc heads of this form arc small, dcnsely
crowded towards the top of the naked peduncles, and
subtended by great bracteal leaves. It is the form of St.
Thomas and St. J an. Thc type specimen of V. Tkomae BENT11.,
however, does not belong to this form, rather to V. albicaulis
sensu strict.

3. The type of V. emarqinata WIKs'rR. Lcaves small
(dim. 2,5 ><1,3 cm), thinly pubescent or nearly glabrous,
obtuse or somewhat emarginated at thc top, rufous—green
(the branches are often rufous-tomentose). Heads small,
6 mm high or so, densely crowded in the top of naked peduncles
forming a rounded inflorescence, or scattered along more
elongated cymes. Pappus brown or tawny. The range of
this form extends from St. Martin to Guadeloupe. How-
ever, V. albicaulis sensu strict. seems to live within this range,
in Montserrat. Perhaps the locality of the specimen in ques-
tion, collected by WEST, is an error.

Also of this form specimens have been seen having very
large leaves (dim. ll ><4,5 cm) and many-ssowered inflores-
cence. So RYAN and WEST from St. Croix (2) and St. Kitts.

4. The type of V. lonqisolia PERS. Leaves lanceolate,
l dm long, 3-—4 cm broad, acute, glabrous or very nearly
so, olivaceous above, pale and somewhat shining beneath.
Heads small, 6-7 mm high, numerous in a broadly pyram-
idal inflorescence. Pappus tawny, not dense. So in Gua-
deloupe and Dominica.

I have not seen the type specimen of V. lonqijolia PERS.,
this probably being in the DESFONTAINES Herbarium at Flo-
rence. I therefore cannot decide if it belongs to the form
just described, or to the following. The very name of the
species, however, applies very well to the form described, and
since it is the more common one, and always has been considered
as the genuine V. lonqisolia, I think it must be that species.

5. The type of V. punctam Sw. Differs from the pre-
ceding in having large heads and white, stiff pappus. The
type specimen of V. punctam SW. has rather narrowed leaves
(dim. 6—7 >< l,2—l,4 cm) and somewhat crowded heads.
Other specimens examined have wider leaves and up to 6
