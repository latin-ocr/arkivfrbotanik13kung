desire to render their sincere thanks for assistance in various
ways. They are further indebted to Prof. J. CER. MOBERG
for informat-ion on geological points.

The occurrence of ocal-bearing deposits in south-eastern
Scania was known already to ANGEL1N‚1 who marked them
in his geological map of Scania. Owing to the delay of the
publication of this map the first record of the formation
made public was ERDMANN’s descript-ion of the geology of
the Ro'ddinge district in 1872‘2 ERDMANN notes the occur-
rence of the formation in a narrow strip stretching in a
north-west — southeasterly direction between the Silurian
in the north-east and the Cretaceous in the south-west. He
describes the lithological character of the rocks, including
the thin seams of poor coal, but mentions no fossils. His
description is accompanied by a sect-ion (fig. 7) showing the
tectonic conditions, which are also discussed in the text.

The first discovery of organic remains in the series was
made by NATHORST who found in 1876 three species of
fossil plants near Kurremfflla, at the valley of the Nybroan.
Another collection, which, however, with the exception of an
undeterminable fragment of a conifer, contained no new spe-
cies, was made in 1880 by A. F. CARLSON. The species
known at the time were mentioned by NATHORs'r in 188O,3
viz, an Anomozamiles-like leaf, similar to A. minor, further a
new species of Equisetum and a fragment of Ctenis not very
different from C. falcata LINDL. of the English Lower Oolite.
NATHORST points out that the plants from Kurremolla, as
far as they were known at the time, are different from those
of the other coal-bearing deposits of Scania and, if it is per-
missible to form any opinion on such a small number of
species, decidedly indicate a somewhat later {sime of deposi-
tion.
