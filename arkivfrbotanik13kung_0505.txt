ward and are usually only divided once. This fragment is
of the O. Roessertffitype, except· that the secondary veins
normally divide only once. Another fragment is shown in
pl. 1, figs. 22 and 23. It is still more incomplete, consisting
only of a portion of a pinnule. It differs from the former
specimen in the venation‚ the secondary veins forming a
wider angle with the midrib and having more diverging
branches. The specimen hereby more approaches the C.
‘nebbensis-type.

There are different opinions as to the relation of C.
nebbensis and (Ὗ. Roesserti, and it is impossible to decide to
which of these species the present fragments should be re-
ferred, should both species be kept separate. The simple
branching of the secondary veins is more characteristic of
G. nebbensis For the present purposes the question is of little
importance, since both species are characteristic Rhaetic plants.

Cladophlebis <Eboracia?) lobifolz‘a (PHILL.) BRGN. appears
to be represented at Rodalsberg by a couple of fragments.
The best of these, of which the counterpart is also preserved,
is figured in pl. 2, figs. 3 and 4. It consists of a portion of
a pinna with several pinnules. These are rather short, ovate,
somewhat acute and falcate, with the distal edge a little
retreciated, the proximal decurrent. As the base of the pinna
is not preserved, the distinguishing character of the species,
viz. the aberrant shape of the proxima] basal pinnule, is not
shown by this specimen. The resemblance borne in other
respects to Cladophlebis lobisolia renders the specific identity
fairly probable, however. Both the shape of the base of
the pinnules and especially their venation agree closely with
typical specimens of C. lobisolia. The venation is especially
characterized by the strong development and double forking
of the secondary veins in the lower part of the pinnule. No
trace of the fructification is preserved, and the specimens
are therefore kept under the name of Cladophlebz's. THO-
