leaves and brown pappus. Analytically, it is characterized
especially by its very small anthers. It varies somewhat
as to the shape and pubescence of its leaves, Specimens from
Porto Rieo (SINTENIS n. 389, 390 0) represent the most narrow-
-leaved form (dimensions of the leaves: 7,5><0,5 cm), which
is at the same time the most densely pubescent; speci-
mens from St. Jan (RAUNKIAER n. 3158) have very wide and
thinly pubescent leaves (dilnensions: 11 >< 5 cm).

The variety mentioned by URBAN, 1911, p. 619: »Van
foliis obovatis vel ellipticis, apice obtusis vel rotundatis.
An species propria? », SiNTEms n. 4749, is most probably a hy-
brid between V. sericea L. C. RICH. and V. albicaulis PERS.
(comparex V. Gleasonii EKMAN, on p. 54 of this paper).

A remarkable variety 01 V. <sericea having white pappus
was described by GLEASON in his »Revision›> as a distinct
species, V. venusta. I have been able to examine a specimen
with white pappus, SINTENIS n. 390 b in the Berlin Herbarium.
which agrees perfectly with the small portion of type specimen
of V. venusta seen. Now, no other difference than that of the
colour of the pappus could be found to exist between V. sericea
and V. venusta, even on the most careful analysis. Moreover,
intermediate specimens have been seen, having stramineous
or brownish-stramineous pappus, for instance, SINTENIS n.
390 b in the KRUG-URBAN Herbarium, SINTENIS n. 3929
111 the Berlin Herbarium. I cannot see any reason for not
reducing GLEASON's species.

Specimens of V. ,sericea L. C. RICH. collected by OERSTED
in St. Thomas have been referred to V. remotijlora L. C. RICH.
and recently cited as that species from the West Indies (GLEA-
SON, 1906 b, p. 175). True V. remotislora does not occur there
at all.

Another specimen of V. sericea labelled »Jamaica,PURD1E». .
but certainly not collected there, has been identified by (31111011-
ssAcH as V. tricholepz's DC. (GRISEBACH, 1861, p. 354), and
by BAKER in Flora Brasiliensis as V. araripensis GARDN.
Neither species occurs in the West Indies.

The geographical range of the species extends over Porto
Rico, St. Thomas, St. Jan and St. CroiX. It has also been
indicated from Hispaniola. However, the plant in question
111 some points differs from the type of the species. and I have
