E. L. EKMAN, WEST INDIAN VERNONIAE. 77

Having attributed the name V. quaplealisolt'a to the plant
herc called V. leptoclada Scir-Bm, GLEASON could find no
name for the genuine V. qnaphalisolia, and consequently in
his »laevis-ion» described it as a new speeies, V. -sublauata
GLEASON. Prof. URBAN, however, called his attention to the
fact that V. sablanata was identical with V. (Jnaphalisolia,
and enabled GLEASON to correct his mis-take himself.

The species is rather variable, both as to the shape (11 the
leaves and the density (11 their pubescence. ln the »Revisiom
GLEASON described a variety myas-tata, 01 the species, having
narrowly oblong leaves. This variety he raises to specific rank
in his »Studies», I remember having seen elsewhere this var-
iety, though I find no notes about it in my lists. lt is, how-
ever, not, probable that it is a speeies. The shape of
the leaves varies strongly in all Vernoniae. If species were to
be based only upon leaf-characters, hundreds of species could
be described on the &Vest Indian material. Evidently there
must be other characters combined with the different shape
and nervature of the leaves to warrant the rank (11 a parti-
cular species. I imagine. that GLEASON will fail to give these
for his V. anqustata.
