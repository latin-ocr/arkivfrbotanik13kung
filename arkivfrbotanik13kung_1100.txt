111 1116 brilliant exposition of the Vernoniae known at that
time LESSING describes a V. arbuscula from Mauritius. My
attention was called to his plant by a statement 01 LESSING
that it recalled V. arborescens (L.) SW. On a visit to Berlin
1 examined the type of the specieS, and was greatly astonished
to recognize in it a throughout typica] V. arctata GLEASON.
The specimen is labelled: »Ex herb. Kunth. Vernonia arbus-
cula n. sp. Isle de Bourbon. Salisbury ded. 1816». It is
a puzzle how Mauritius (z Isle de Bourbon) came to be
-designed as the habitat of the plant3 quite certainly it is a
typical V. arctata GLEASON.

Though strongly resembling V. bahamensis GRISEB.,
V. arbuscula is a good species, differing from V. bahamensz‘s
in the shape and colour of its leaves, as well as in their nerva-
ture. In V. bahamensz's the latera] veins are 4—6‚ ascending
at oblique angles, in V. arbuscula they are only 2—3, issuing
at nearly right angles,

A species of very peculiar habit due to its small, broad,
cui-led, (1611661)γ tomentose leaves and few, solitary heads.
