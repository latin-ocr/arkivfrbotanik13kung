ering any constant forms, and that Ihave examined numbers
01 flowers 101 1110 331110 purpose. But in vain. The forms pass
evidently into each other, and their particular habits are
probably due to the particular circumstanees in which the
plants have lived. However, the types of the three different
names 01 1110 species, V. arborescens, V. icosantha, and V. ven-
tosa, represent, as it happens, each a particular 101111 01 1110 spe-
0103, yet not in such a way, that the species could be divided
throughout into three series each corresponding 10 0110 1131110.
For the intergrading forms are as numerous as the typieal
ones, The three forms may be briefly characterized.

l. The type 01 V. subcrescens (L.) SW.: Leaves broad,
dim. 11,5 0111 111 length, 5 0111 111 Width, thinly membrana-
ceous, nearly glabrouS, with broadly rounded and slightly
cordate base. Infloreseence very laX, the heads at a distance
01 2-4 0111 and subtended by bracteal leaves, the lower 01
which are nearly as large as the leaves themselves. Evidently,
this is a 101111 01 damp, shady localities. 80, 101 1113131100,

2. The type 01 V. icosantha DC: Leaves large, somewhat
narrowed, up to ll 0111 long, 4 em broad, attenuate at the
base, 111111, nearly glabrous. Inflorescenee somewhat dense,
the heads more crowded, 1 0111 01 30 apart, the bractea] leaves
smaller, the upper ones linear, not longer than the heads.

3. The type 01 V. ventosa GLEASON: Leaves small, lanceo-
late-ovate, usually 6 em long, 2 em wide, 111111, rounded or
attenuate at the base, strigose pubescent, 011011 grayish or even
whitened beneath. Inflorescence generally dense, the brae-
1031 leaves small. 80 DUSS n. 303, 304, 984. HAHN in 1870
represents an interesting 101111 with leaves 01 V. ventosa and
infloreseenee 01 V. σιν-0010300118.
