species, V. brachypoda URB., but afterwards published it
as V. acuminata. (URBAN, 1903, p. 391), apparently consider—
ing it to be a liighland form of this species. GLEASON in his
»Revision›> is of the same opinion: »LESSING's V. acuminata
is described with aggregated heads, resembling NICHOLS
20 and 120, a character possibly due merely to the habitat,
since the latter grew in an altitude of 5000—-7400 feet». In
his ›>Studies›>, however, he does the species abundant justice,
describing it under three different names, V. pluvialis, V.
proclivi-s and V. reducta. Though I have not seen authentic
specimens of these three species, Ι do not doubt that they are
only forms of one species. The differences given by GLEASON
are merely inconsiderable ones, based on the shape of the¹
leaves and the number of flowers in the heads. V. pluvialis
is said to have (5——)S-flowered heads and oblong-ovate to
sub-rliomboid leaves, 3—5 cm long, l,1—l,9 cm wide, V.
‘proclivis has S-flowered heads and elliptic-oblong leaves,
which are 6—8 cm long and 2-3 0111 wide, V. reducta is
described as having 5-flowered heads and narrowly elliptic-
-oblong leaves, 4—4,5 cm long by l,2—l,6 cm wide. The
specimens examined by me, clearly belonging to one single,
although rather variable, species, show the following data
as to the characters 111 question:

lt will be seen that there is considerable variation as to
the width of the leaves, their shape varying accordingly from
oblong-rhomboid with very shortly attenuate base to 1110111- .
boid-lanceolate with long-attenuate base. As to the number
of flowers I never found heads with only five, though I examined
NICHOLS 120 cited by GLEASON under V. pluvialis.

The three species of GLEASON were all collected in the
higher mountains of Jamaica, partly in the same localities
— one of tho numbers cited, BRITTON n. 3851, is quoted both
under V. pluvialis and under V. proclivis. It seems, therefore,
highly probablc that the three speciOS, in fact, constitute
ono single, though very variablc, species.
