scribed somewhat similar stems with zones of different kinds
of scars. A determination of the present fragments or any
closer comparison with other known forms is clearly im-
possible.

Desmiophyllum sp.
Pl. 6, figs. 1—3.

The fragments shown in pl. 6, figs. 1—-3, are best men-
tioned under the provisional name Desmiophyllum.

The specimens represent portions of linear leaves, or
segments of compound ones, reaching a length of 3-4 cm,
with a breadth of up to 7 mm. The specimen in fig. l is
distinctly tapered towards the base, the one in fig. 2 has
almost parallel edges. Both specimens have simple, parallel
veins, 8-12 in number. In the specimen in fig. 2, there can
be seen a much finer interstitial vein between each two of
the stronger ones (fig. 3). There is some difference between
the specimens. The one in fig. l has denser veins and shows
no interstitial veins, though it may well possess such. The
occurrence of intermediate speoimens, however, renders the
identity probable.

It is impossible to state the exact nature of these fragments.
They may represent portions of simple, tape-like leaves and may
in that case belong to Phoe'nz'copsis ΗΕΕΒ.1 Of HEER’S species
two are stated to have a fine interstitial vein between each
two of the stronger ones, viz, Ph. speciosa (HEER, l. c.; pl. 29,
figs. l, 2; pl. 30) and Ph. latior (ibid.; pl. 31, figs. 1—6; pl.29,
fig. l c). It is possible, however, that the specimens repre-
sent segments of leaves of a Βαίενα, of which genus some
species are described as having similar interstitial veins (HEER,
1. c.). The best course is, under these circumstances, to use
the non—committal name Desmiophyllum, which does not ex-
press any opinion regarding the affinities.
