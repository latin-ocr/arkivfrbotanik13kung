The (111101011005 existing as 10 1110 shape of corollas, 51Ζο
of anthers 010. have been generally regarded as being of little
importance in delimitating species and groups in Vernonia.
In order to ascertain 11 these characters actually have no
value, 1 110170 analyzed numbers= 01 110117015 01 011 1110 species
mentioned in this paper, and 01 many South American ones. In
general, the characters found agree with those of habit and
inflorescence, and 110 striking results have been obtained.
Yet they have proved to be 01 501110 1701110 101 recognizing
smaller groups 01 1110 subsections and 101 identifying the spe-
cies. More interesting is the fact stated through these exam—
inations 01 1101117015 11101 the basal lobes 011110 011111015, which
are said 10 be obtuse in Vernonia.‚ sharply acute in Pipto-
carpha, very often are acute in Vernonsia 100. Τ1115 should
mean that the only difference between Piptocarpha and Ver-
nom'a vanishes. I hope I shall have an opportunity to
return to this in another paper. ¹

As characters 01 1110 110117015 010 seldom mentioned in j
the descriptions 01 Vernoniae‚ I have under each species ¹
listed in this paper given its analytica] distinctions. ,

As to 1110 species theniselves,there will be found to exist
a certain (111101011οο between my treatment 01 1110 West In· ³
dian 01105 and that 01 GLEASON‚ not only in regard to their
names, but to their delimitation. In GLEASON's paper the
species are very small, narrowly defined and, as 0 11110, based
upon a very meagre material3 my species are in general
much wider. including several 1011115 described by him as
proper species. Yet my work also 1105 been compiled upon
the principle: to separate what can be separated practically.
It may be that GLEASON has another conception 01 5Ρο0105
111011 Ι 110170, 05 North American botanists on that point 011011
differ 110111 European ones (cfr. ΟΤΤΟ KUNTZE, Rev. gen..
plant.> Band ΙΙΙῙῙ, 1898, p. 144, the note). It is, possibly, be-
yond his reach to conceive, 101 instance, the striking common
features 01 1115 V. arborescens, V. intonsa, V. pemmonis, V.
alticoma and V. amarantlmssna, which is the evidence 01 111011
being all merely forms 01 0110 species. He keeps, apparently,
his mind open 10 1110 differences, not to the affinities. But
he will, I am sure, not fail to find that, with the descrip-
tion of new species like the above mentioned, the delimita-
tion 01 1110 already existing ones will become always more
