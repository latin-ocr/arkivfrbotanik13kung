to this, This presumption is clearly supported by the geogra-
1 phical distribution of the species in question.

2. The allies of V. arbores—cens (L.) SW.

Three 51100105, V. arborescere& (L.) swa, V. albieaulis szs..
and V. borinquensis URB. They are all shrubs, much branched
and rather tall. The inflorescenee is many-Hmvered, spread-
ing or somewhat eongested, especially so 111 V. albicaulis.
'The corolla is glabmus, in rare cases with a few short hairs
at the tips of the clefts. The bristles of the inner series of pap-
pus are fine, yet persistent, and five to seven 1111105 longer
than those of the outer one. The anthcrs are rather large,
about 2,5 111111 long.

The geographical range of this group extends from the
island of Margarita near the coast os Venezuela over the Les-
561· Antilles up to Porto Rieo V. arborescens is, may be, the
primitive type of tho group, being confined to the Windward
Islands. From it V. albinam-s ean be derived direetly‚ strue-
turally and geographieally‚ oeeupying the Leeward Islands
and Porto Rieo. V. borinquensis Ι suppose to be a more
recent offshoot from V. arborescens. ³

3. The allies of V. balzamensis GRISEB.

Three speeies of the Bahamas‚ V. bahamensis GRISEB„
V. arbuscula LESS„ V. obem-data GLEAsoN‚ and one species
from eastern Cuba, V. complicata GRISEB. They are distin-
guished from V. arborescens and its allies by the dense tomen-
tum of their leaves and branches and by the highly reduced
inflorescenee. The three Bahaman species (at least two of
them) are, besides, characterized by the existence of a few
long hairs at the tips of the clefts of corolla3 in V. compli-
cata these hairs are lacking. The group can be derived direct-
ly from V. albieaulis. The Cuban speeies evidently derives
its origin from the Bahamas, and is to be looked upon as the
most recent offshoot of the Arborescens-Balmmensis-branoh.

4. The allies of V. fruticosa SW.

Five speeies of Jamaiea, V. divaricata SW„ V. acumi-
nata Lnss„ V. expansa GLEASON‚ V. pluvialis GLEASON and
V. riqicla Sw„ one species of south-western Hispaniola, V.
fruticosa (L.) Sw., and four little-known speeies of eastern
Cuba, V. parvuliceps EKMAN‚ V. yunquensis GLEASON, V.
leptoclada SCH.-B1P. and V. pineticola GLEASON. They are
distinguished from V. arborescens and its allies by the broader
