can be observed but it is possible that such exist (figs. 14
and 16). The specimen in fig. 17 is fertile, with rather large,
rounded impressions of sori, of which the structure cannot
be ascertained but which are probably placed between the
secondary veins.

It seems permissible to refer these specimens to Lacco-
pteris on account both of the sori and the venation. The
earlier illustrations of the type-species, L. eleqans PRESL‚1 <lo
not show any anastomosing of the veins‚ but SEWARD² has
stated that such occur in typical specimens both of this
species and of others.

The material is much too poor for a specific identification,
but the specimens may be compared with such belonging to
a couple of known species. The venation shows a certain
resemblance to that of L. eleyans PRESL (1. c.)‚ especially in
regard to the fact that no anastomoses can be observed,
though such may exist. In L. eleyans, as mentioned above,
the venation was not found to be anastomosing until the
species had been known for a long time. The straight and
parallel course of ‘the lateral veins towards the margins is
another character common to both forms, but the same occurs
in other species, too, especially in L. Woodwardi (LECK.) Smnss
This species appears to come fairly near to L. eleyans, and in
the first illustration given of it (LECKENBY, l. c.) the vena-
tion is not represented as anastomosing. SAPORTA‚4 who refers
the species to his new genus M icrodz’ctyon, notes the anasto-
moses, and so does SEWARD (l. c., p. 85, fig. 11 Α.). Espe-
cially the figures given by SAPORTA, in which the anastomoses
are rather few, greatly resemble the present fragments, and it
is very possible that these may belong to L. Woodwardz' rather
than to L. eleyans. Under such circumstances, a specific
identification is clearly impossible, even were the specimens
much better than is the case.
