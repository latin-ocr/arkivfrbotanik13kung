the type being somewhat different from V. divaricata, above
all in its elongated corollas (7 mm). It remains, however,
probable that the particular habit 01 V. albicoma is connected
with its occurrence in shade localities and, since the idea 01
the unity of V. divaricata SW. as here understood seems to
me very admissible, the species having no very near relative
in Jamaica, I have dccided to place V. albicoma under V.
divaricata SW. Besides, there are intermediate forms between
V. albicomaend V. divaricata, 101 instance, WILSON n. 238.

In the following I have tried to characterize with a few
words the most prominent forms 01 V. divaricata. What
I have said about the forms 01 V. arborescere& (L.) SW. and
V. albicantis szs.. might be verbatim repeated here.

1. The type 01 V. divaricata SW.: Leaves nearly glabrouS.
Cymes widely spreading, many heads without bracts. Scales
cream-coloured, inner ones not purplish, relatively long-acu-
minated. Besides the type specimen in the Stockholm Her-
barium, there belong here the specimens collected by DISTIN.
A specimen collected by WILLIAM WRIGHT in the Stockholm
Herbarium has shorter cymes3 HANSEN in 1897 has more
densely pubescent leaves; PURDIE in the Kew Herbarium
has leafy cymes.

2. The type 01 V. albicoma GLEASON: The most glabrous
1011111 Ι11110168061106 rather lax. Heads comparatively large,
inner scales somewhat elongated, purplish. Corolla 7 mm
in length. CANLPBELL n. 6152.

3. The typeof V. arborescere& GLEASON, not 01 SWARTz:
The central form, having rather tomentose leaves, shorter,
arcuated, nearly leafless cymes, with somewhat aggregated
heads. Inner scales purplish, shortly acuminated. To this
WILSON n. 238, EGGERS n. 3481 etc.

4. The type 01 V. arborescens SW.: A densely tomentose
form with short cymes, crowded headS, and purplish, shortly
acuminated inner scales. The type specimen 01 V. intonsa
GLEASON belongs here, further HARRIS n. 5622. LEHMANN
11. 989 and HARRIS n. 6993 represent intermediate forms
between V. arborescere& GLEASON and V. arborescens SW.

5. The type 01 V. permollit* GLEASON: The most densely
tomentose form with broad, rounded leaves, short, nearly
bractless cymes, and very crowded heads. The scales are
glabrous towards the tip, or with a tuft 01 hairs near it. The
