parallel to the rachis. The result is that the pinna-rachis
appears to be accompanied on each side by a nearly straight
parallel longitudinal vein.

The areas limited by the seeondary veins and the mid-
ribs are often deeply 00110616 on the impressions of the
upper side: this-must thus have been bulging out between
the veins. ZEILLER (l. c.; pl. 17, figs. 1-5), who has de-
scribed, from the Rhaetic of Tonkin, the best specimens
known of this species, has been able to state that the fields
are filled up by a network of finer veins, which the preser-
vation does not permit of being observed in the Swedish
specimens. The Swedish fragments appear all to be sterile.

Woodwardites microlobus is a rather rare species, being
known, outside of 8061116, only from Franconia., Poland and
Tonkin, In Scania it has been found, according to a com-
munication by Prof. NATHORST, at Stabbarp. In all these
districts the species occurs in Rhaetic beds.

A little fragment, too small for definite identffication,
may possibly belong to Thaumatopteris Schenki NATH. It
consists only of a portion of a pinnule which is somewhat
curved, probably accidentally. The specimen 13 shown in
pl. 1, fig. 17. The shape has evidently been linear, and the
margin is very slightly incised, with broad, rounded lobes.
The venation 13 indistinct‚ but appears to resemble that of
Thaumatopteris Sclzenlcz'.

Thaumatopteris Sclzenkz' 13 known from several localities
in the area of the ocal-bearing deposits of NW. Scania,
where it characterizes one ‘of the higher horizons of the
Rhaetic series, Outside vaeden it has been recorded from
Bornholm, Poland and Franconia, occurring in all these dis-
tricts in Rhaetic strata.
