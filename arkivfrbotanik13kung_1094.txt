forms 01 1116 species do not live anywhere within its range.
In the northern part 01 11 round-leaved forms with tawny
pappus (10111111616, towards the South narrow-leaved ones
with white pappus become numerous. It is a remarkable
fact that V. albicaulis thus on the 6011111166 01 1116 range of V.
arborescens (L.) SW. becomes like that species, though al-
ways recognizable by the characters of the involucres and
by the acute basal lobes 01 1116 611111616. If this is due to ¹
some ancient *hybridizatiom or 11 V. albicaulis and V. arbo- ἵ
16866713 are to be looked upon as rather recent offshoots 01 J
one species,⁸the southern forms being almost unaltered descend-
ants 01 1116 60111111011 type, or 11 1116 1661 01 matter is, that either
of 1116 species (most probably V. arborescens) on its migra-
tion has been altered by the 10166 01 611111616 11110 1116
011161, 1116 forms in question owing their existence to a
particular intermediate climate, 01 course cannot be discussed
here.

It may, perhaps, be 01 601116 use to characterize the most
prominent forms 01 1116 species and to give their distribution.

1. Τ116 type 01 V. Sintenisii (URB.) GLEASON: Leaves
small, oblong (dimensions: 3 ><l,2 cm), obtuse or even emar-
ginated, thinly pubescent with appressed hairs, somewhat seri-
oeous-shining. Heads relatively small, about 8 111111 long.
Pappus pale straw-coloured. This is the form 01 Porto Rico.
However, not all specimens from this island are true V.
Sintcm'sii GLEASON. Some of them agree almost exactly with
the type 01 V. albicaulz's szs„ for instance, SINTENIS n.
470, others cannot be distinguished from V. emarqinata
WIKSTR., so STAHL n. 730.

2. Τ116 type 01 V. albicaulis PERS. Leaves oval (dim.
5 >< 3 cm), obtuse at the apex and shortly attenuate at base,
very thinly pubescent, not shining, grayish-green or grayish-'
-olivaoeous. Heads small, 6—7 mm long, in number 4—5 on
slightly recurved cymes, somewhat apart. Pappus very pale
straw-coloured. This form occurs in its most typica] shape in
St. Croix, where it was collected by the ancient Danish bot-
6111616. The original specimen at Paris came from VAHL,
as did the types 01 Eupatorium obtusisolium WILLD. and Ver-
‘aonia Vahliana LESS.

To this approximate two forms, one having very large, acute
leaves (dim. 13 >< 6,5 6111) and larger heads (9—10 mm long),
