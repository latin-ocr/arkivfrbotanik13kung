Cladophlebis sp. [os. O. (Εὸογᾴοῑα) zobisozia (emm.) BRGN.]
Pl. 2, figs. 19, 20.

The genus Cladophlebis is represented in the Kurremolla
flora only by some few imperfect specimens, the best of
which are shown in pl. 2, figs. 19 and 20. The specimens
consist only of portions of pinnae bearing some ovate-
triangular pinnules. In their shape, attachment and venation,
these strongly recall those of Cladophlebis (Eboracia) lobifolz‘a
(PHILL.) BRGN. As the pinna-bases with the basa] pinnules,
the peculiar shape of which is the most important character
of C. lobz'jolia, are not preserved, the specimens cannot, how-
ever, even provisionally be referred to that species.

clathropterisz or Dictyophyllum? sp.
Pl. 3, fig. 12.

In pl. 3, fig. 12, is shown, in twice the natural size, a
little fragment of a fernfrond belonging to the group of the
Dictyopterideae‚ probably to Clathropteris or Dictyophyllum.
The somewhat square shape of the meshes formed by the
anastomosing venation would appear to indicate the former
genua but this character is not very pronounced and the
material is too poor to permit of any further conclusion.
Some other fragments of the same character occur, but these
are of still poorer quallity.

Lac001)te1·is sp. 1.
Pl. 3, figs. 13—'17.

Some few fragments of fem-pinnules, both fertile and
sterile, can be identified as belonging to the genus Laccopteris.
They appear to belong to two different forms, but a specific
determination is not possible. Those described as no. 1 are
figured in pl. 3, figs. 13—17.

The specimens consist only of small portions of pinnules,
which measure 3—5 mm. in breadth. From the strong mid-
rib are given off, at a wide, almost right angle, secondary
veins which branch more or less freely. No anastomoses
