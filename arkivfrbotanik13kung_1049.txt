I confess to have learnt one thing from the North Ame-
rican botanists — not to describe innumerable varieties under
each variable species, as do many European 11013111515. In
dealing with vernoniae, one should be satisfied to state to
which species a certain plant belongs. In order to give an
idea 01 1110 variability 01 501110 species, I have, however, de-
scribed some 01 their most striking forms. though without
indicating any form by a proper name.

As to the history etc. 01 1110 genus Vernom'a in the West
Indies, I refer to the interesting exposition given by GLEASON

be found under the respective species in this paper.
