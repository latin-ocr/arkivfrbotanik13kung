2 ARKIV FoR BOTANIK. BAND 13. N:o 15.

Herbarium. At first, Ι intended to publish some corrective
remarks to GLEASON’S Revision, but I soon made up my
mind to give a full account of all West Indian species of Ver-
nonia, worked out upon a basis of type specimens available
in European herbaria. In the course of my work I have been
able, through the kindness of the curators of the Regnellian
funds, to visit the following herbaria:

Berlin. The herbarium of the Konigliches Museum
contains the types of the species described by LESSING‚ WILL-
DENOW, and SPRENGEL‚ further, the rich collections of the
KRUG-URBAN Herbariurn, which through the courtesy of
Prof. IGN. URBAN have been sent to me on loan, and are
the main basis of my studies.

Brussels. The herbarium of the Jardin Botanique
is oi' especial interest to students of the South American Ver-
noniae, as it contains the types collected by MANSO‚ LIND-
BERG, and others

Geneva. The Prodromus Herbarium contains the
types of DE CANDOLLE. In the DELESSERT Herbarium I have
found duplicate specimens of the types of some French and
Spanish botanists, viz. L. C. RICHARD and LA LLAVE et LEX-
ARCA. The BoISSIER Herbarium contains a very good series
of WVRIGHT'S Cuban plants.

London. The Kew Herbarium possesses the types
of GARDNER.

Mu nich. Here the types of MARTIUS are kept, described
in the Prodromus by DE CANDOLLE.

Paris. The collections of the Museum d'Histoire Na-
turelle are of the greatest importance, containing the types
of LAMARCK‚ L. C. RICHARD, HUMBOLDT-BONPLAND-KUNTH‚
CAserI, and others. The COSSON-DURAND Herbarium, which
is kept apart, contains the types of SCHULTz-BIPONTINUS.¹

Ι have, further, had on loan some material of Vernom'a
from the British Museum and the Museums of Copenhagen,
Florenoe, Gottingen (of especial interest, containing the
types of GRISEBACH)‚ Lund, St. Petersburg, Upsala, and
Vienna. I beg to render my sincerest thanks to the di-
rectors of all herbaria now mentioned.

then quoting the specimenS, I have indicated, in
parenthesis, in which herbarium they are to be found. The
letters in parenthesis signify:
