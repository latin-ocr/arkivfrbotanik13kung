Natiirlichen Pflanzenfamilien. A few modifications have,
however, been made, chiefly according to the works of GLEA-
SON. Like many North American botanists, he tends to split
up large genera into smaller ones. I agree with him
in renioving Laclmorlziza A. Rmfl„ Leiboldia Sca-Bw„ and
Cyafntlzvillium BLUME (z Cyanopis BLUME) from Vernom'a,
but I do not approve the segregation of Eremosis (DQ). There
are numerous species connecting Eremosz‘s with Critoniopsis
Sca-Bm, which genus always has been considered a section
of Vernom'a. In fact, there are no characters of Eremosis
that cannot be found again in certain species of other sec-
tions of Vernonia. Eremos-is (DC.) GLEASON was character-
ized by 1—5-flowered heads in rounded panicles, and Ver-
nom'a by 8—88-flowered heads. However, there are many
true Vernonjae having as few-flowered heads as have the spe-
cies of Eremosis, for instance, in the sections Critoniopsz's
and Stenocephalum (Sca-Bm). As for the rounded pan-
icles, GLEASON himself has defined a division of Lepidaploa‚
Pasniculatoe umbellz'jormes, having ›>subu1nbellate‚ rounded
panicles».

Three isolated species have been transferred in this
paper‚ one to the genus, and two from it. Prof. URBAN in 1899
described a Piptocarpha tetrantha from Porto Rico, nearly
allied to Piptocarpha trislora ΒΕΝΝΕΤ from Guyana. The
latter Piptocarpha is a genuine Critoniopsis, being closely
related to the type of the genus, Critoniopsis Lindenii ΒΘΗ.-

ΒΙΡ. from Columbia. If Critoniopsis be referred to Verno- ,
nia, Piptocarpha trijlora BENN. and Piptocarpha tetrantha ξ

URB. must be so too. It is another question whether Cra·- ³

toniopsis inclusive of Eremosis are not to be genericallyl

distinguished from Vernonia. Ι will return to this subJ'ect
elsewhere. - ‚

The two plants removed from the genus Vernonia are
V. Zepiclota GRISEBAOH and V. Millerz· JOHNSTON. The former,
‹liffering already in habit from all true Vernoniae of the West
Indies‚ above all in its lepidote pubescence, is abundantly
distinct in the structure of its pappus. The bristles of the
inner series of pappus are very few, 5—6-7, broad, caducous‚
thc scales of the outer series are concreted with each other, jorm-
27129 a short, cylindrical tube. The plant is related to Pip-
sacoma CASS., which gemm, however, has free outer scales,
