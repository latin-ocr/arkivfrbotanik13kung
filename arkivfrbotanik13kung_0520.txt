Laeeopterisss sp. 2.
Pl. 3, figs. 18—20.

The fragments shown in pl. 3, figs. 18—20, may be pro-
visionally referred to Laccopteris but, like those described
above, they cannot be specifically identified with any degree
of certainty.

The venation of the present form differs from that of
the preceding one by showing very frequent anastomoses.
The meshes thus formed are very small, short and wide, and
thus the venation has not the parallel habit· characteristic of
sp. 1. Some branches of the secondary veins are stronger
than the others and anastomose to form a series of large
meshes on each side of the midrib. There are no traces of the
fructifications.

In regard to the venation these specimens show a great
resemblance to the Bathonian M icrodictyon rutenicum SAPORTA
(l. c., p. 3093 pl. 33, figs. 2—43 pl. 35, fig. 33 pl. 44, fig. 5),
which has also the same bow-shaped anastomoses of the stron-
ger secondary veins. It is possible, therefore, that the form
should rather be referred to the genus M icy—odictyon SAP. The
character of the venation mentioned is not very marked,
however, and it would appear as if the difference between
that genus and Laccopteris was not very distinct. Phlebo-
pteris Woodwardi LECKENBY (l. c.), which is brought by SAPORTA
(l. c., p. 313) to M icrorbictyon‚ is referred by SEWARD to Lacco-
pteris, and one of the figures given by that author (SEWARD,
l. c., p. 85, fig. ll C) of another species, L. polypodioides,
shows a distinct approach to the Microclictyon-type.

There is another difficulty in the classification of these
ferns which may be mentioned here. Both Laccopteris and
Alterodz’ctyon are used for forms with a certain and in both
cases similar kind of fructification indicating decidedly lepto-
sporangiate affinities. lt has been shown recently¹ that the
genus Nalhorstia HEER, which has synangia of marattiaceous
nature, possesses a venation very like that of Microdictyon.
It is evident therefore that the character of the venation is
not a sufficient proof of generic identity with Microdictyon
