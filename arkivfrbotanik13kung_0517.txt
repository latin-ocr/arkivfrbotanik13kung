Sphenopteris sp. (Cf. Dicksonia pauciloba MoLL.)
Pl. 3, fige. 9-11.

In pl. 3, figs. 9 and ll, are shown a couple of specimens
of a Sphenopteris, which are too imperfect to be definitely
determined but seem to be closely comparable with the
form described by Momss1 as Dicksom'a pauciloba.

The specimens consist of fragments of pinnae with a
number of pinnules attached, and convey no idea of the
shape of the frond. The pinnules are directed forward, are
ovate in shape and attached in one point but a little de-
current on the pinna-rachis. They are almost entire or
slightly lobed, with one or more rarely two rounded lobes
on each side. The venation is distinct. consisting of a slen-
der midrib and almost equally strong secondary veins, which
divide once or twice.

This form belongs to the common type of Mesozoic
ferns Which group themselves round Sphenopteris (Coniopteris)
hymenophylloz'des BRGN. It comes particularly near to some
specimens described by MoLLER (l. c.) from the Bagaa flora
in Bornholm as Diale-sonia paucilcba. This species is charac-
terized by almost entire or slightly and obtusely trilobate
pinnules. The present form is hardly distinguishable from
some of the Bornholm specimens — the pinnules are perhaps
more often entire —— but the material is insufficient for a
certain determination. The Bornholm form is sterile and
therefore, in accordance With a modern classification, should
be referred to Sphenopteria Since there exists already a
Splefenopteris pauciloba, the species should accordingly have a
new name.

The type of frond, to which these specimens belong, is

a common one in Mesozoic rocks but is especially characteristic
of the Middle Jurassic.
