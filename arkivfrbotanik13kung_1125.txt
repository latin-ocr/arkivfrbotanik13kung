In the year 1792 L. C. RICHARD described, very briefly,
some plants sent by Mr. LEBLOND from G uyana to the Societee
d'Histoire Naturelle of Paris. Among these plants there was
a Vernonia which Pacuium called Vernonz'a (err. Veromssa)
sericea, and characterized as follows: »fol. lineari-lanceolatis,
subtus sericeo-incanis, ubique tomentosis, subintegris: floribus
alternis, secundis sessilibus albis ›>. This description, of course,
is too narrow to characterize a Vernonia, and it seems there-
fore as if nobody has been able to identify tho specics, By
chance (at least so it appears) the name V. sericea was applied
to a plant common at Rio de Janeiro, although this did not
agree with the description, and was never collected in Guyana.

WVhen, in the summer of 1912, Ι examined the Vernoniae
of the DELESSERT Herbarium at Geneva, Ι found a specimen
of what, at that time, Ι called V. phyllostachya (CASS.)
GLEASON, labelled Vemania sericea Rmfl„ LEBLOND n. 337. At
first, I could not understand the meaning of this determination,
but I soon was able to ascertain that the plant in question was
the type, or a duplicate of the type. of the mysterious Ver-
mnia sericea L. C. RICH.

The brief description of V. sericea quoted above will be
found to agree perfectly with V. phyllostaclzya (CASS.) GLEASON,
except for the colour of the flowers. However, typically
purple-flowered Vernoniae very often occur with white flowers.
Further, the type locality of V. sericea is indicated to be Guyana,
but V. phyllostachya has never been collected there. It often
happened, however, in that early age of Botany that
the habitats of plants described were interchanged. Since
LEBLOND also collected in the West Indies (compare URBAN,
Notae biographicae, Symb. Antill„ Vol. 3) it is therefore evident
that this plant came from there, and not from Guyana.

Singularly enough Ι could not find at Paris any specimen
of V. sericea collected by LEBLOND.

The species thus renamed is one of the most richly re—
presented in herbaria. It is easily recognized by its sericeous
