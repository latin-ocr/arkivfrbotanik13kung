The identity of the Kurremolla specimens with Saqeno-
pteris Mantellz· appears at least very probable. The resem-
blance to typical specimens of the Wcalden species is ex·-
pressed both in the shape of the leaflets and in their open
venation. There is especially a very close agreement with
the specimens figured by WARD ¹ from the Lower Cretaceous
Shasta Flora of North America3 but the specimens from the
European VVealden also appear to be very similar, though the
existing illustrations do not give any very clear idea of the
venation.

Prof. SEWARD, in a recent paper‚2 remarks that the
Swedish specimens are »100 incomplete to be referred to that
type with any degree of certainty». This imperfect nature
of the material is the only reason why the form has not here
been actually included in S. filantem: the identity with that
species, however, appears much more secure than is the
case nuth rnany (mher specunens generassy accepted as be-
longing to it. The age of the present specimens is quoted
by Prof. SEWARD as probably Middle Liassic. In the paper
by HALLE quoted above, the age of the Kurremolla beds is
stated to be not older than Middle Lias but possibly younger.
The closer examination of the flora now completed has given
the refflsst that st ὴ probabbrrnuch youngen and whatever
its precise age may be, the evidences of Wealden affinities
have been steadily accumulating. The formerly supposed
Liassic age of the specimens can thus no longer be upheld
and consequenffly·is nd reason aganffit the very probabha
identity with S. Mantelli.
