Vernoma macilis H. B. K. is a plant common in the
dry plains of Columbia. Like all Vernoniae it is highly vari-
able, especially as to the pubescence of the leaves and the length
of the subulate tips of the scales. V. Moritziana SCH.-BIP.
was described upon a form with very short tips. The genuine
V. macilis has leaves nearly glabrous beneath. Ι have based
the new subspecies upon specimens having the leaves densely
floccose-tomentose beneath. Just because of this pubes-
cence ὃΗΙΕΒΟΝΥΜΠε took the same plant to be V. Cotoneaster
(W.) LESS„ a species from Bahia, differing from V. macilis
in its smaller involucres. The material at hand of the sub-
species is too meagre to give a reliable idea of its systematic
rank3 perhaps it is a distinct species.

It is puzzling that V. macilis subsp. tomentosa has been
found to occur in Bequia, far away from its proper region,
which is Columbia.

Specimens from Trinidad agree exactly with the genuine
V. triceplaala from Brazil.

GmsEBAoH cites, 1861, p. 354, two West Indian plants
as belonging to V. tricholepis DC. Neither of them belongs
to that species, the former, Jamaica, PURDIE, being V. se-
ricea L. C. Rieu„ certainly not collected in Jamaica, the second
is just V. meapham GARDN.
