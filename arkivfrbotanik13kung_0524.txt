Nilssonia fallax NATH. is the commonest as well as the
best preserved of all the plants at Kurremolla. It was dis-
covered, in fragmentary specimens, by Prof. NATHORST in
1876, and was first referred by him to Anomozamites, though
with the remark that the veins are simple. Since better ma-
terial had been procured‚ especially by Prof. MoBERG‚ Prof.
NATHORST was able to state, in 1909, that the plant is a
Nilssonia. It was referred by him to a new species, N.
fallax, with the remark that it might be regarded as a 1016-
111111161 10 N. schaumburyensis 01 1116 Wealden‚ but it has not
hitherto been described or figured.

Frond pinnate, linear, mostly 1—3 cm. broad and at
least 10 cm. long, gradually tapered towards the base and
more rapidly contracted towards the apex. The lamina is
dissected into more or less regular segmenta which are at·
tached by the whole 01 111611 bases to 1116 upper surface 01 1116
rachis. The segments vary much in breadth‚ but are usually
rhombic to oblong, more or less obliquely truncate or round-
ed at the apex. The veins are parallel, mostly simple, only
in single cases bifurcating (pl. 4, fig. 6) or joining each other
towards the apex. Their number is 15-25, usually 20, in a
centimetre.

The habit is very like that of an Anomoza‘mites 01 1116
type 01 A. minor or A. qracilz's, though the veins, as already
mentioned, are normally simple. The attachment 01 1116
segments to the upper surface 01 1116 rachis, however, clearly
demonstrates the Nilssonia-chsmacter (pl. 4, figs. 9 and 10).
The shape 01 1116 apex, as shown in pl. 4, fig. 7, also shows
the characteristic habit of that genus.
