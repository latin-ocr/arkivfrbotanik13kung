Introduction.

Fossil plant-remains were discovered in the coal-bearing
Mesozoic deposits of south-eastern Scania by Prof. A. G.
NATHORST already in 1876. Though a small number of the.
species have been identified by him and mentioned in the
literature on several occasions and a couple of others‘have
been described by the present writers, a connected treat-
ment of the flora has hitherto been wanting. In the present
paper all the fossil plants at present known from this series will
be described and the age of the different floras discussed.
The work was commenced by HJ. BIoLLER, who has also
studied the stratigraphical conditions in the field and collec-
ted part of the material. The descriptions of the species
and the discussion of the correlation of the floras is the
joint work of both authors. In addition to the species al-
ready mentioned in the literature a number of others had
already been identified by ProfiNATHORST, to whom the authors
