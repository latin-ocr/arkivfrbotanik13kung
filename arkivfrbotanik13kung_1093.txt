unique c Martinique». This specimen is in the LAMARCK

Herbarium at Paris3 no collector is given. —Martinique,
PLirE n. 957 (Ρ). The specimen may be from Porto Rico,
where PLfiE also collected. —— Martinique, DUSS n. 302

(KU); according to the label the plant was collected in 1890,
and since DUSS that year collected in Guadeloupe, it is very
probable that his plant came from that island, inasmuch
as it agrees perfectly with other specimens from Guadeloupe,
for instance, DUSS n. 2489. — Martiniquc, DUSS n. 4070
(KU). The label of this specimen reads: »N:o 4070. Pere
Duss, Herbier de la Martinique. Vernonia lonqisolia PERS.
ex GLEASON in literis, Casser coutelas. Haut de 1¹‚s2—31s‘2
m. fl. violacecs ou violet pale ou blanches. Abondant, ss. de
Juin en 10-bre. Case Pilote. Alt. 2—450 m. Le Aofit 1899».
According to this the plant should be common at Case Pilote
,111 Martinique. But then it is puzzling that it has not been
, collected there more than once. Most probably the label in
{question originally belonged to a specimen of V. arbor-escaus
¹1(L.) SW.‚ and has been interchanged afterwards. URBAN
states in his Notae biographicae that there are many errors
of locality on the Dussian labels. —— Santa Lucia: leg.
CRUDY (M); probably from St. Thomas, where CRUDY also
collected. — St. Vincent: leg. ANDERSON (K). The speci-
men resembles those from Guadeloupe, and may have been
collected there, or in another island near it.

There is a specimen of V. albicaulis in the Paris Herba-
rium, the locality of which »e Caroline, ΤΠ. NOISETTE», if
meant for the North American state by this name, clearly
must be an error.

As indicated by the numerous synonyms, V. albicaulis
is highly variablc. Outlying forms of it, such as V. punctam
Sw., V. lonqisolia PERs. and V. Sintenisz'z’ GLEASON have been
described as distinct species. However, it is the same case
with V. albicaulis as with other Vernoniae, for instance,
V. a'rborescens (L.) SW. and V. divaricata Sw.: the whole set
of forms constitutes a variable, though always easily re-
cognizable, species with a particular geographica] range,
each form considered as a species becomes impossible to
delimitate. The only consistent way is therefore to take
V. albicaulis as the wide species here conceived.

It must be acknowledged, however, that the different
