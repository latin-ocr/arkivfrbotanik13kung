HJ. M6LLER AND T. G. HALLE, FOSSIL FLORA OF SE. SCANIA. 7

HALLE ¹ as Sayenopteris cons. Mamelli (DUNK.) [S. Manlelli
is a characteristic plant of the Wealden.] In the same paper
(p. 8) a Sayenopteris from Rodalsberg is mentioned as possibly
belonging to S. Nilssoniana (BRGN.) WARD.

The species here stated to occur at Kurremolla are men—
tioned also by NATHORST2 in 1910. Referring to the possi—
bility, first pointed out by ΤὸΒΝΕΒοΗΜ & HENN1G‚ that the
strata at Kurremolla may be inverted, NATHORST states that
the composition of the flora far from being in opposition to
rather seems to favour the idea that the plant-bearing strata
are younger than the Cardiam-bed. He accordingly places
this deposit, under the name of the »Zone with Nilssonia
fallax», at the top of the table showing the different horizons
of the Rhaetic-Liassic series. MOBERG,3 in the same year,
gives detailed descriptions of the principal exposures in the
district, but, beyond mentioning the most important of the
species of fossil plants, gives no further information on the
flora.

 

In this paper the floras of Munka T5garp, Rodalsberg and
Kurremolla will be described separately.

1. The Flora of Munka Tagarp.

Regarding the geology of the locality at Munka Tagarp
reference may be made to the foregoing review of the geolo-
gical exploration of the district, in particular to the section
shown (after TORNEBOHM & HENNIG) in our text-fig. 1 (p.
4) and to MOBERG's description (1893). The plant-bed lies
at the very base of the inverted ocal-bearing series, only 1,5
m. from the contact to the Keuper. It has·a thickness of
only 2 cm. and consists of a black, fractured clay which easily
breaks into small shivers. On account of this lithological
character of the rock the plant-remains found are very small,
measuring only a couple of centimetres at the most. In the
same bed occur also small fish-scales.
