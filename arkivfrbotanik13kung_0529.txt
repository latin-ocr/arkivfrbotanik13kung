that author (pl. 2, fig. 4) under the name of Elatides curvi-
jolia var. Bramlttana.

There is no doubt that this species is better placed in
Elatides, the definition of which genus should include the
nature of the cones, than in Paqioplzyllum. The latter genus
ought to be reserved for forms with much thicker and
shorter leaves, like those of the majority of species described
under that name, especially by SAPORTA.

Elatides curvisolz'a was originally described from the
Wealden of Germany. The specimens mentioned above as
figured by NATHORST from Spitsbergen are derived from
beds belonging to the transition between the Jurassic and
the Cretaoeous.1

Elatocladus sp.
Pl. 6, figs. 7, 8.

The coniferous remains shown in pl. 6, fig. 7, though
fairly well preserved, do not present any evidence as to their
affinities. The specimen is sterile: the indistinct cone-like
impression to the right may not belong to the shoot and
gives, at any rate, no information as to the structure of the
fructification. It seems best, therefore, to employ the pro-
visional name Elacocladus2 in this case. The shoot is of the
radial type, with spirally arranged leaves. These measure
5-—10 mm. in length and about 1 mm. in breadth, are some-
what falcate, gradually tapering and acute at the apex. In
addition to this specimen, there occur in the same locality
isolated leaves of conifers ‘which may well belong to the
same species. Two of these leaves are figured in pl. 6, fig. 8.
They agree well with those of the branch in fig. 7, but are
larger and especially broader.

A specific identification of the fragments here described
with any known form is impossible and the material is much
too poor to warrant the institution of a new species.
