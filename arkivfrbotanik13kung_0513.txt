HJ. MoLLER AND T. G. HALLE, Fossn, FLORA or sn. scANIA. 19

There can be no doubt that the Rodalsberg flora is
either Rhaetic or Liassic, but to which of these formatioris
it should be referred can hardly be decided on the basis of
the present material. The balance appears to be, perhapS,
somewhat in favour of the Rhaetic, as the only species which
is not compatible with a Rhaetic age, viZ. Cladophlebis cs.
lobisolz'a, cannot be definitely determined. It would appear,
however, from a survey of the plant—remains, that the flora
of Ro'dalsberg is younger than that of Munka Tagarp‚ as it
should be in regard 10 1118 stratigraphy. Of the three spe-
cies of the Munka Tagarp flora only Gutbz'era anqustiloba is
found at Rodalsberg, but the vertical distance between the
two horizons is not very great —- apparently less than the
distance between the plant-bearing stratum of Rodalsberg
and 1118 Cardiam-bed, which is referred by MOBERG to the
lower part of the Middle Lias.

3. The Flora of Kurremolla.

Kurremolla is the most important of the three localities
at which plant-remains have been collected in the coal-
bearing series of south—eastern Scania. Regarding the geology
reference may be made 10 1118 historical review at the be-
ginning of this paper‚ especially to the section in our text-
fig. 2 (p. 6), to MOBERG’S monograph of 1888,1 and to his
guide of 1910.2

The locality was visited in 1903 by MoLLER who endeav-
oured 10 identify the 88011011 described by ΜΟΒΕΒΘ.1 Owing
to the rapid weathering of the rocks and the covering by
vegetation, this proved impossible, and a new section was
opened. This is situated in the same cutting as that described
by Monimo, i. e. S. E. of the mill of Kurremolla, somewhat
Ε. of the brock of Kurremolla, or 92 paces from the bridge,
following 1118 road to Reddinge.

The following strata were noted, in descending order.
