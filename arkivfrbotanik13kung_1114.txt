It is puzzling that GLEASON did not see this species well
represented in herbaria, or that it has not been collected
by the active Cuban explorers. In fact, it is one of the easiest
recognized species of the 441111016366ναῶ-810119 and, once seen,
impossible to overlook. Among the species known to me it has
no near allies. According to the description, however, V. vicina
GLEASON approaches somewhat to our plant, but is distin· ¹
guished by its larger involucres. which are said to be »about
5—ss mm high». Probably there are other differences, but it
is not easy to obtain an exact idea of V. vicina from GLEASON'S
description. ‘

and larger heads.

Not seen. The species seems to be a fairly well-marked
0116, related to the preceding, but differing in its obtuse, sub-
