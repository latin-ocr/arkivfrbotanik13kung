(or with Laccopteris, if that name be used). It may be
proposed therefore, as a better course, to use a provisional
generice name for sterile specimens of the Microdz'ctyon- (and
Laccopterz's-)type. Phlebopteris BRGN„ if correspondingly de-
limited‚ might possibly be employed for this purpose. It is
not intended to discuss this question here, however, since it
will be necessary, before forming any decision‚ to make a
comparative study of the venation of the various species of
M icrodictyon and Laccopterz's, for which purpose the available
illustrations are not sufficient.

In addition to the Bathonian M ior-odictyon rutenicum there
are a couple of forms belonging to the Wealden which show
perhaps an equally great resemblance to the present speci-
mens. Onc of them is Laccopteris Dunkeri ΞΟΗΕΝΚ, especially
as illustrated by HOSIUS ὅτ. VON DER ΜΑΒΟΚ,1 but this species
generally has much larger pinnuleS.

The small Saqenopteris first mentioned by NATHORST
(l. c.) from Kurremfflla, has already been figured and de-
scribed as S. cs. Mantellz· (DUNK.) (HALLE, l. c.). The spe-
cimens are refigured here, in pl. 3, figs. 21—24.

The specimens consist of detached leaflets of an obovate
to elliptical shape, with broadly rounded apices and with
entire or slightly undulating margins. The venationis of
the typical Sayenopteris-charae-ter. A midrib existis, at least
in the specimens in figs. 22 and 24, but it is not very marked
and evanesces before reaching the apex. The network formed
by the anastomosing Veins is remarkably open, With broad
and comparatively short meshes. The specimen in fig. 24
has somewhat narrower meshes: it is possible that it may not
belong to the same species,
