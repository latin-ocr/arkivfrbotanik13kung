few words about the characteristics of the plants in question
may be of interest.

V. riqz'da, as described by SWARTZ, is a woody winding
shrub having flexuose, densely tomentose branches, rounded,
rigidly coriaceous leaveS, being 3—4,5 cm long by 2,5—3 cm
wide, somewhat shining above, glandulose and finely pubescent
beneath, especially on the veins. The tomentum is often more
eopious towards the margins of the leaves. The cymes are
leafy, freely flexuose, the heads distant, sometimes two or
three in the axils. The involucres are elongated, up to 15
mm high, infundibular, long-attenuate at base3 the scales
are imbricated in numerous serieS, the outer ones deltoid‚
carinate, nearly glabrous, creet-appressed, the inner ones
elongated, spreading, the dry and open involucres thus re-
sembling stars.

The specimen presented to MONTIN agrees in leaf-cha-
racters perfectly with V. r'z'syidfss· may be the leaves are a little
thinner, and more narrowed, 4 cm long by 2,2 cm wide. It
has, further, exactly the same pappus and fruit. However,
the involucres are very differently shaped. They are only
6—7 mm high, broadly obconic, shortly attenuate at base,
the scales are shorter and more densely pubescent. Probably
this is the normal form of V. riyida, the ,type specimens be-
longing to a form with abnormally elongated involucres. Such
formae imbricatissio'nae occur not infrequently in South American
species, for instance, in V. oliqactoides Lnss„ V. nitidula LESS.,
and V. squammosa HOOK. ARN.
