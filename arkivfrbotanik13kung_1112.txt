Another Vernonz'a, the history 01 which begins with
PLUMOER and SURIAN. Like V. arborescens (L.) Sw„ it was
figured in PLUM. ed. BURM., and on this figure LINNAEUS based
his Conyza fruticosa. Since there was no specimen of it preserved,
its identity remained mysterious to 10016111616, and the name
V. fruticosa (L.) SW. has been applied to many West Indian
species, recently to V. riqida SW. (GLEASON, 1906 b, p. 182),
SWARTZ himself comparing this species with V. fruticosa. It
was not until PICARDA recollected it about the year 1889
that Prof. URBAN was able to identify 1116 species, as shown
by the remarks on the labels 01 1116 specimens in the KRUG-
-URBAN Herbarium. In fact, there can be no doubt that
this identification is correct. Especially MIGUEL FUERTES
n. 655 agrees perfectly with the figure in PLUM. ed. BURM.
There is moreover not a word in the description 10 11161 figure,
PLUM. ed. BURM. p. 83, that does not apply 10 0111 plant. Its
phrase name »C'onyza frutescens, Oydom‘ae solio» is singularly
apposite, the leaves resembling throughout those 01 Cy-
donia vulyaris L„ their pubescense being nearly the same.
BURMANN’s particular phrase name (or diagnosis'Z) 01 1116
plant: »Conyza 101116 0176116, 661116 1111116060, floribus axilla-
ribus solitariis, sessilibus» and his description: »Planta 111111-
cosa, ramulis flexuosis, a 10110 ad folium eleganter inclinatis.
Folia alterna, obtusa, undulata, venosa. Flores solitarii
in quavis ala sessiles» are apparently made 110111 PLUMIER's
figure, giving no character beyond this, and consequently agre-
eing perfectly with our plant.

V. fruticosa is hitherto only found in the south-western
part 01 Hispaniola, where it appears to be rather frequent.
Its nearest allies are the Vernoniae 01 Jamaica, as also some*
species 01 eastern Cuba, especially V. calophylla GLEASON.

Though the material at hand is not abundant, it indicates
a certain variability 01 1116 species. Two fairly distinct forms
can be distinguished. One is represented by the plants
collected by MIGUEL FUERTES. It has long, leafy cymes not
forming a distinct inflorescence3 the scales 01 1116 1111701116166
are acute and elongated. The second form has smaller leaves,
shorter 6511166 1171111 111016 approximated heads and bluntish
scales. 11 appears 10 be the common one. Possibly the two
