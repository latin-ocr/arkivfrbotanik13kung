ganz gerecht ist3 denn Swartz hat doch erkannt, dass die
Conyza arborescens eine Vernonia ist, und hat die Combina-
tion richtiq vollzogen. VVas bei ihm darauf folgt: ‘Beschrei-
bung und Vaterland ist allerdings falsch. Wenn Sie genau
sein wollen, konnen Sie schreiben:

V. arborescens (L.) SW. (quoad syn. Linn., non quoad
descript. nec patriam. ’

Auch die Nordamerikaner verfahren so von ihrem Princip
der 'Priority in place’ aus».

For further illustration to this point I refer to ΗΙΤΟΗ-
00οΚ, North American species of Panicum, Contr. U. S. Nat.
Herb„ Vol.,15‚ 1910, p. 6, and to URBAN, Symb. Antill„ Vol.
VH, 1913, p. 342.

V. arborescere& (L.) Sw. is evidently the Vernonia of the
WVindward Islands, being known from Martinique, Santa
Lucia, St. Vincent, Bequia and Margarita. There are only
two points indicating a wider distribution of the species.
In the Prodromus Herbarium Ι found a plant from Havana
collected by DE LA OSSA, and referred to V. arborescens
(L.) SW. β ovatifolia Do.; it is, however, a typical V. arbo-
rescens (L.) SW. Nothing is known about ΒΕ LA OSSA collecting
in Martinique, so that it must be supposed that the plant
occurred at Havana. Most probably it grew in the bo-
tanical gardens of that town, of wich DE LA OSSA was
director. Further, GLEAsoN asserts that he has seen specimens
of his V. ventosa from Guadeloupe. I venture to suppose that
this statement is due to a confusion with ,the large—headed
form of V. albicaulis PERs. common in that island. In
fact, DUSS n. 2812, representing this very form, was deter-
mined by GLEASON in a letter to Prof. URBAN as V. ventosa
GLEASON. In his »Studies›> 116 cites the same plant as V. ico-
samba DC. (GLEASON, 1913, p. 307).

An interesting locality for the species is the island of
Margaiita near the coast of Venezuela, rather distant from
its main region. It occurs there in a somewhat different
form, hardly at first sight recognizable as V. arborescens.
In habit it resembles a rigid V. Trinitatis EKMAN, but is easily
distinguished from that specics by its small heads.

Like many W'est Indian Vernoniae, V. arborescens is ex-
tremely variablc. I need not insist that I have repeatedly 1
lookcd over the abundant material on the chance of discov- {
