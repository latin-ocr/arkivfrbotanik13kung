higher horizon. The plants indicating a relation to the rich
Middle Jurassic floras are with one exception represented
by a very poor material in the Kurremolla flora, but they
outnumber the equally questionable forms which can be
compared with Liassic ones. The exception is Equisetz'tes
Moberyii, which is represented by numerous well preserved
specimens. This species shows a closer relation to Ε. Run-
buryanus from the ltalian Oolite than to any Lower Jurassic
forms, but it appears to be still more closely comparable
with E. Lyellz· of the Wealden.

It cannot be denied that the flora shows a closer relation
to that of the Wealden than to any other flora. In addition
to Equisetites ῙΙΙοόενςίί, which, as already stated, appears to
come very near to E. Lyelli, there are three other species
which indicate Wealden affinities. These are Saqenopteris cs.
Mantellz', Nilssom‘a fallax and Elatides cf. curvisolz'a. The
most important of these is Nz‘lssonia fallax, which is very
common and represented by an excellent material. This spe-
cies is all but indistinguishable from N. schaumburqensis,
which is a typical member of the Wealden flora. Both
Saqenopteris cs. Mantelli and Elatides cs. curvijolia agree so
closely with the corresponding Wealden forms that there can
be no great doubt- as to their identity with them.

If it is thus evident that the flora shows a greater affi-
nity to that of the Wealden than to any other, it would be
rash to conclude that the plant-bearing beds are of Wealden
age. The slight indications of the presence of older elements
in the flora· alluded to above warns us against such an opinion;
and, moreover, it should be borne in mind that the Upper
Jurassic floras are rather little known and their relation to
the Wealden flora proper not very clear. It is quite possible,
therefore, that the plant-bearing beds at Kurremolla belong
to the Upper Jurassic. The distance which separates them
from the Car-dium-bed is hardly great enough to grant suffi-
cient room for the whole Middle and Upper Jurassic, unless
there is a hiatus in the series.

A fact which should be noted in this connection is
the lack of true Wealden deposits within a great distance
from our district. The nearest deposit to be considered for
comparison is a plant-bearing clay at Holsterhus in Born-
holm. The fossil plants collected there by Dr. K. A. GRoN-
