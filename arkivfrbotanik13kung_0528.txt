The specimens of a conifer shown in pl. 6, sigs. 4-6,
do not permit cf a definite identification with any known
species, but it appears at least very probable that they
should be referred to Elatides curvz‘solia (DUNK.) NATH.

The specimens in figs. 4 and 5 represent sterile shoots.
They have rather thick stems, about 5 mm. broad on the im-
pressions, which carry spirally arranged leaves. The leaves
are 10- 15 mm. long, falcate and probably somewhat acute.
The preservation of these specimens is unfortunately rather
unsatisfactory.

It is at least very probable that the specimen in fig. 6
of the same plate represents a female cone belonging to the
same species The preservation of this specimen does not
permit of any details being made out, but it is evident that
the cone had a cylindrical shape: the impression measures
about 15 mm. in breadth. It would appear as if the cone-
scales were prolonged into or carried long falcate appendages.
These very much resemble the leaves of the sterile shoots in ’

figs. 4 and 5, and thus tend to support the probability that 2

the cone belongs to the same species as these sterile shoots.

The probability of a connection between the sterile shoots
and the cone is strengthened by the fact that both agree
with corresponding specimens of Elatides curvisolia (DUNK.)
NATH. This species was first described as Lycopodites1 and
was later identified as a conifer and referred to Pachyphyllum,2
which name, being already employed, has since been discarded
for Paqz'ophyllum. The closest agreement with the present frag-
ments is shown by some specimens from Spitsbergen figured by
NATHORST (l. c.‚ pls. 1, 2, 4). The cone in our pl. 6, fig. 6, bears
an especially great resemblance to a specimen figured by
