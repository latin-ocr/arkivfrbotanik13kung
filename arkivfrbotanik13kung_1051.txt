E. L. EKMAN, WEST INDIAN VERNONIAE. 9

Α3 to the description and distribution of the species
I refer to URBAN, l. c.

The genus Critoniopsis θαι-13117. was· based upon a plant
from columbi-a, Critoniopses Limlenic‘ Scir-Bm„ nearly re-
lated to Piptocarpha trijlora BENNET from Guyana. Now
Piptocarpha tetrantlea is said to be closely allied to P. triflom,
and hence I conclude, without having 30011 specimens of UR-
BAN's plant, that it is a C'rilom'opsis. This genus has always
been considered a section of Vernonia„ It> differs from the
genuine Vernoniae of the section Lepidaploa in having, as
a rule, few-flowered heads, caducous inner involucral scales
and acute basal lobes of the anthers. There exist, certainly,
forms intermediate between Critoniopsesss and Eremosis (DC.)
Gnmsw, for instance, V. (Eremosz's GLEASON) Heydeana
COULTER, so that the species of Eremosz's must be referred
to Critoniopsis. Some specimens of Eremosz's have persistent
inner scales. The Brazilian species of Gritoniopsis, sor instance,
V. discolor LESS„ have throughout typical Vernom'a-inflores-
cence as well as many-flowered heads. Many genuine Lepida-
ploae have acute basal lobes of the anthers. It will be seen
that there is no character to distinguish Critoniopsis generic-
ally from Vernom‘a.

The genuine Piptocarphae have a characteristic inflores-
cence, dense axillary clusters of heads, and differ in habit widely
from Oritom'opszsss However, there are genuine Vernoniae
having the same inflorescence as Piptocarpka, for instance,
V. Vauthierana DC. (referred erroneously by BAKER in Fl.
Bras. to Piptocarplzaf). It seems to me as if Piptocarpha should
be made a Section of Vernonia, having been primarily con-
sidered so by LEserG and DE CANDOLLE.
