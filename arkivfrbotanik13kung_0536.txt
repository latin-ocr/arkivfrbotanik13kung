WALL have been described by BARTH0L1N1, who states that
the flora may be regarded as a mixed flora containing ele·
ments both from the Rhaetic and the Oolite and finally some
that point in a direction towards the Wealden. The older
elements‚ however, are much more numerous than in the
flora of Kurremolla, and the relations to the Wealden are
fairly insignificant. The only form that is identical or closely
comparable with one from Kurremolla is a specimen figured
— as it would appear with good reason - under the name
of Saqenopteris Mantelli DUNK.22 There can thus not be
stated to exist any close relation between the Kurremolla
flora and that from Holsterhus.

There are some facts, however, which seem to indicate
that the Wealden of northern Germany extends further to-
wards the north—east than is generally acknowledged. Numer-
ous erratio boulders which, on the basis of both included
invertebrate fossils and the lithological character, have been
compared with the rocks of the Wealden formation proper,
have been found far outside the area of occurrence in situ
of that formation. They are known from the coasts of
Holstein, Mecklenburg and Pommern and even from Scania
and the Danish Ιες163.2 GRoNWALL3 has pointed out that
the distribution of these boulders would seem to point to an
origin of the same from the area between Scania, Bornholm
and Riigen. With all due allowance for the fact that the ¹
determination of thel geological age of these boulders is not
definitely settled, it appears thus probable that the Wealden
occurs in the basin of the Baltic not very far from the
district of Kurremolla. “

Even with due regard to the facts just related and to
the unmistakable affinity to the Wealden presented by the
flora, the reference of the plant-bearing series to that forma-
tion is not justified at present. The character of the flora,
however, proves sufficicntly that these beds, as already stated
by Prof. NATHORST‚ are younger than the rest of the Jurassic
series known in Swedcn.
