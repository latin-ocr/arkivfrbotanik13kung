14 ARKIV FoR BOTANIK. BAND 13. N:o 7. ’
MAS 1 has recently studied the fructifications of English speci-
mens and referred the species to a new genus, Eboracia,
considered to be allied to the Cyatheaceae.

Cladophlebis lobijolia is typically an Oolitic species, and
is known from Middle Jurassic rocks in several districts. In
Tonkin it appears to occur already in the Rhaetic, and it is
also a characteristic member of the Bagaa—flora of Bornholm,
which is considered to be Liassic and shows agreement both
with Rhaetic and Middle ‹Iurassic floras. It has not hitherto
been recorded from Sweden.

Gutbicra angustiloba PRESL.

A very small fragment, measuring only about 3 mm. in
length, probably belongs to this species. In spite of the
small size, the identification is fairly certain because of the
characteristic areas shown by the fragment, of which both
countcrparts are preserved. For further reference, see above

Laccopteris sp.
Pl. 2, figs. 9, 10.

A few fragments of fern-pinnules‚ two of which show
traces of small and indistinct sori, may be mentioned under
the generic name Laccopteris. The best specimen, which is
sterile, is figured in pl. 2, figs. 9 and 10. As is shown by
the enlarged drawing in fig. 10, the venation anastomoses‚
close to the midrib‚ to rather small meshes. These are not
always distinguishable‚ however. Taking into account the
place of the sori, and since SEWARD2 has shown that Lacco-
pteris has anastomosing venation‚ it appears permissible to
refer the present fragments to that genus, but a specific
determination is naturally impossible.
