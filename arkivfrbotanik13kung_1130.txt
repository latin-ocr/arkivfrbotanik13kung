for instance, in St. Thomas. This supposition is made more
probablc by the fact that another Vernom'a, V. albicaulz's,
which certainly does not live in¹ Hispaniola, is in the
Berlin Herbarium labelled: MAYERHOFF, Sto. Domingo in
1852. It represents the form of V. albicauh's common in
St. Thomas,

The type specimen of V. racemosa DELPONTE has not been
examined. Since the description of this species agrees exactly
with the Hispaniolan plant, and the type was collected there
(by BERTERO), there can be no doubt as to its identity.

In the LAMARoK Herbarium at Paris there is a specimen
of the subspecies labelled: »Conyza de Mr. DE BADIER, dela
Gnadeloupe, n. 44 ». In the Prodromus Herbarium, however,
the same label is affixed to V. arborescens SW. β. ovatifolia
DC„ i. e. to V. albz'caulis PERS. -— a fact illustrating how plants
have been confused in ancient times.
