HJ. MC'JLLER AND T. G. HALLE, FOSSIL FLORA OF RE. SCANIA. 3

The next contribution to tho geology of the district was
given by MOBERG,¹ who found in 1882 a rich marine fauna
in strata apparently overlaying those containing the plant-
remains. The fauna is stated to be rather different from that of
the other Rhaetic-Liassic deposits of Sweden. Later on (1885)
MOBERG made at Kurremolla a fine collection of fossil ρΙειηῖε.2
In 1882 MOBERG also found fossil plants in another locality,
viz. at Riidalsberg, N.W. of Tosterup.³ These plants were
collected in two ¹different strata, the lower consisting of a
white or grey shale, the upper of a rusty brown sandstone.
The flora of the higher bed, from which ΜΟΒΕΗΟ1 mentions
a species of NILSSONIA, is our Flora of Rodalsberg. In
his monograph on the Liassic of south-eastern Scania4 Mo-
BERG concludes that the fauna of the marine fossiliferous
bed at Kurremfflla, which he names the »Cordium-bed», be-
longs to the lower part of the Middle Lias, The plant-
bearing strata of this locality are stated to underlay this
Cardiam-bed. At Rodalsberg‚ on the other hand, the rust-
coloured sandstone including the plant—remains lies appa-
rently above the same Cardiam-bed.

In.1893‚ ΜΟΒΕΒΘ5 gives new and important information
on the geology of the coal-bearing series. He states that the
plant—bearing beds at Rodalsberg are covered conformably
by strata belonging to the Keuper; and from this fact he
infers that the whole series of strata, which are in all the
sections steeply inclined, must here be inverted and the
plant-bearing bed thus older than the Cardiam-bed. From a
black clay near the base of the coal-bearing series he men-
tions two species of fossi] plants‚ determined by NATHORST
as Woodwarclites microlobus SOHENK and Gutbiera anqusti-
loba PRESL, which both indicate the upper Rhaetic. These
plants will be described below under the Munka Tagarp
Flora, of which they are the only members determinable
with certainty. In the same paper, MOBERG also mentions
