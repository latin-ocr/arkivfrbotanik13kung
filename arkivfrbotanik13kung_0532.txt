mm. long. They consist of a slender petiolar basal portion
and an upper flattened lamina which :forms about a right
angle to the stalk. This terminal lamina is somewhat roun-
dedly triangular in shape, with a diameter of about 2 mm.
The stalk appears to be attached to the inner surface of
the lamina, but near its lower margin. Numerous pollen-saes
may be seen in some of the specimens. There would seem
to be several of them attached to each sporophyll‚ but the
number cannot be ascertained nor the manner in which they
are borne. The pollen-sacs are pear-shaped, with the point
of attachment at the narrow end. They are about 1 mm.
long or somewhat less. Their contents could not be examined.

Car-polithus sp. 1.
Pl. 5, figs. 6, 7(?).

Several specimens of seeds occur at Kurremolla. They
belong to different forma which, however, are not well enough
characterized to be identified with previously known ones or
to be described as new species. They may be mentioned
under the generic name Garpolithus and designated by differ-
ent numbers.

Of the form designated as sp. 1 only two specimens exist,
which are figured in pl. 5, figs. 6 and 7. The specimens are .
rather different, ands it is possible that they belong to dif-
ferent specieS. They have both the same ovoid shape, but
the one in fig. 6 is larger (12 mm. in length). A feature
common to both specimens is the occurrence of a distinct,
thinner border, or wing, running lengthwise round the seed.
The spotted aspect of the surface of the larger seed is of
accidental nature and (lue to some patches of the vegetabe
tissue being preserved.

There is a certain resemblance between especially the
larger specimen and a seed described by ΝΑΤΗΟΒΞΤῙ from
the Rhaetic of Hoganiis (younger) under the name of Oar-
polimus cinctus. The material does not permit of an identi-
fication‚ however, neither with that species nor with any
other.
