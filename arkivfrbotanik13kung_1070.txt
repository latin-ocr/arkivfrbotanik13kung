has its origin t-here, though in the West Indies showing a
particular and independent evolution.

Within the vast assemblage of species constituting the
Arborescentes smaller groups can be distinguished. They
do not appear as sharply definable taxonomic units, the exist· ⁷
ence of which could not be denied3 on the contrary, they are
but vaguely indicated, and very difficult to characterize. Sub· .
jective susceptibility may also play some part in the percep-
tion of these delicate taxonomic sensations. However, con-
sidering every method of arranging species according to their
natural relationships preferable to an artificial arrangement,
I have tried to give an exposition of the Arborescentes based
011 their supposed relationships. The species have been
arranged according to characters about the value of which
for recognizing groups in Verozonia very little is known, such
as consistence and relative length of the pappus, pubescence
of the corolla, length of the anthers etc. Or, mutatis mu-
tandis, the groups recognized have been found to differ in
those points. Now such characters are not convenient for
identifying specimens the names of which are required. I
have, therefore, given an artificial key in order to facilitate
such identificationS.

The smaller groups concerned have not been named.
They are based upon too small a material and are, as already
stated, too vaguely indicated to deserve that certificate of taxo-
nomic importance which a name betokens. However‚ a few
words upon their characteristic features and their geogra-
phica] ranges may be advisable.

1. The allies of V. (crqyropappa BUEK.

One species of Trinidad. As already mentioned it ap- ·
proaches very nearly to certain Mexican and South American
specieS, the best known of which is V. arqyropappa BUEK„
Another member of this group is the widely distributed‚ annual
V. remotijlora L. C. RICH. By their floral characters these spe-
cies cannot be distinguished from the allies of V. arborescere-3
(L.) Sw. The differences are chiefly habitual ones, such as ,
larger involucres, subula‘oe, spreading scales, the outer of which s
are slightly recurved> etc,

Tho striking resemblance between V. Trinitatis and
V. arbores-cens· has made mc believe that the latter has taken
its origin from V. Trinitatis or from some species nearly allied
